# iCentral Test Incremental QUBE

`icentral-test-incremental-qube` is an advanced Rust crate designed for efficiently calculating betweenness centrality updates in dynamic graph structures. The primary focus is the implementation of algorithms facilitating the rapid updating of centrality scores upon incremental changes, such as edge insertions, exploiting the properties of Minimum Union Cycles (MUCs).

### Features
- **Incremental Centrality Computation**: Quickly update betweenness centrality scores leveraging MUCs without computing from scratch.
- **Efficient Edge Handling**: Seamlessly integrates new edges using specialized graph data structures for skewed properties.
- **Performance Analysis**: Built-in functions to monitor and log computational time, speedups, and other performance metrics compared to traditional Brandes algorithm.

### Usage
This crate requires setting up a `Graph` type with specific trait implementations:

```rust
use icentral_test_incremental_qube::exp_inc_qube_p;

let mut graph = /* initialize graph here */;
let rand_edge_vec = /* vector of edges to insert */;
let brandes_time = /* timing from Brandes computation */;

exp_inc_qube_p(&mut graph, None, &rand_edge_vec, brandes_time).expect("Failed to update betweenness centrality");
```

### Mathematical Concepts
- **Betweenness Centrality**: A measure of a vertex's significance in terms of the number of shortest paths passing through it in the graph.
- **Minimum Union Cycles (MUCs)**: Graph substructures used here to optimize the edge insertion process leading to expedited centrality recalculations.

### Technical Requirements
This crate requires the implementation of several traits for the `Graph` generics, such as `InsertEdgeUpdateMuc`, `NodeIdToMucId`, and others, facilitating the interaction with the graph's internal structure.

### Safety and Warnings
The crate is designed with performance in mind. Ensure that graph operations do not lead to unintentional data races or memory issues, particularly under concurrent contexts.
