# iCentral Test Fast Brandes

This Rust crate implements a highly optimized version of the Brandes algorithm for computing betweenness centrality in graphs. The algorithm is pivotal in network analysis, providing insights into the importance of vertices in a network. Utilizing advanced optimization techniques, this crate significantly reduces computation time, making it suitable for large-scale graphs.

## Features
- Efficient computation of betweenness centrality.
- Designed for performance with large datasets.
- Utilizes Rust's 2021 edition features for enhanced safety and concurrency.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-test-fast-brandes = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
Import the crate and utilize the functions to compute centrality metrics for your graph data. Refer to the function documentation for precise usage instructions.

```rust
use icentral_test_fast_brandes::compute_centrality;

// Example usage
let centrality = compute_centrality(&my_graph);
println!("Betweenness Centrality: {:?}", centrality);
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss potential changes.

## Acknowledgements
This project draws on established research in graph theory to deliver efficient network analysis tools.
