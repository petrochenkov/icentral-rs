# Icentral-Mindexed-Map

`icentral-mindexed-map` is a Rust crate providing a versatile data structure with dual functionalities: indexed and mapped collections. This crate offers the ability to seamlessly transition between vector-based indexed storage and hash map-based key-value storage. The primary goal of this crate is to offer flexibility and efficiency in handling collections, catering to varying needs of index-based and key-based data storage.

## Features

- **MaybeIndexedMap Enum**: A flexible data structure allowing the use of either vectors or hash maps.
- **Efficient Iterators**: Built-in iterators for traversing indexed and mapped structures.
- **Range and Node-Based Access**: Support for standard and custom indexing through `NodeId`.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes methods for map creation, clearing, filling, reservation, and key extraction.

## Data Structure Description

- **MaybeIndexedMap<T>**: An enum implementing either an indexed representation using `Vec<T>` or a mapped representation using `HashMap<NodeId, T>`.
  - `Indexed(Vec<T>)`: Utilizes a sequential vector for storage, suited for dense data.
  - `Mapped(HashMap<NodeId, T>)`: Uses a hash map, ideal for sparse structures.
- **MaybeIndexedMapIterator<T>**: An iterator over `MaybeIndexedMap`, providing efficient traversal of both representations.
- **NodeIdEnumerate**: Facilitates enumeration with a node identifier.

## Use Cases

- When you need both dense and sparse data storage in a single application.
- Scenarios requiring switching between fast index access and flexible associative mapping.

## Example Usage

```rust
use icentral_mindexed_map::{MaybeIndexedMap, NodeId};

fn main() {
    let mut indexed_map = MaybeIndexedMap::new(5, 10);
    indexed_map.set(NodeId::new(3), 20);

    println!("Indexed Map: {:?}", indexed_map);

    let mut mapped = MaybeIndexedMap::<i32>::default();
    mapped.set(NodeId::new(1), 42);
    mapped.set(NodeId::new(2), 99);

    println!("Mapped: {:?}", mapped);
}
```

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor.
