# iCentral Graph Hash

`icentral-graph-hash` is a Rust crate designed for efficient manipulation and analysis of weighted graphs. The main struct, `GraphHash`, offers functionality for representing graphs with integral nodes and efficiently managing their structures and properties. 

## Overview

Graph theory offers compelling tools for solving complex problems in numerous fields, such as network analysis, computational biology, and social network analysis. This crate leverages advanced concepts in graph theory, including betweenness centrality computation via Brandes' algorithm and various graph traversal mechanisms, to provide robust tools for researchers and developers alike. 

## Features
- **Efficient Edge Management:** Insert, remove, and check for edges with optimized operations.
- **Node Mapping:** Offers integral indices for nodes and allows flexibility beyond the simple range constraints.
- **Connected Components Detection:** Retrieve sizes of all connected components or isolate them into separate subgraphs.
- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Implements breadth-first search (BFS) to compute single-source shortest paths efficiently.
- **Graph Pruning:** Leverage pruning strategies to optimize graph connectivity algorithms.
- **Betweenness Centrality Computation:** Calculate the importance of nodes through their roles in connecting shortest paths.
 
## Code Example

```rust
use icentral_graph_hash::{GraphHash, Edge};

let mut graph = GraphHash::empty("my_graph");
graph.insert_edge(&Edge::new(0, 1));
graph.insert_edge(&Edge::new(1, 2));

let components = graph.find_conn_comp().unwrap();
for component in components {
    println!("Component: {:#?}", component);
}
```

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-graph-hash = "0.1.0"
```

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
