# iCentral-Edges

`icentral-edges` is a Rust crate designed for advanced manipulation and analysis of graph edges, providing extensible trait-based interfaces for edge-centric operations. This library caters to developers working with complex graph data structures, offering elegant solutions for edge management and traversal.

## Features

- **Edge Management**: Easily track, add, and remove edges in your graph with traits like `InsertEdge`, `RemoveEdge`, and more.
- **Graph Traversability**: Efficiently query edge connections with `connects`, `edges_to_node`, and `edges_from_node` methods.
- **Data Structure Implementation**: Employs `HashSet` for optimal edge storage and retrieval.
- **Custom Naming**: Support for naming edge collections with `SetName` and related methods.
- **Batch Operations**: Create edge collections from vectors or sets and extend existing collections.

## Getting Started
To utilize `icentral-edges`, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-edges = "0.1.0"
```

Implement the provided traits on your graph structures to seamlessly integrate edge functionalities.

## Usage Example

```rust
use icentral_edges::{Edges, InsertEdge, RemoveEdge};

let mut edges = Edges::empty("my_graph_edges");

// Insert an edge
let result = edges.insert_edge(&Edge::new(1, 2));
assert!(result.is_ok());

// Check for connections
assert!(edges.connects(1, 2));

// Remove an edge
let result = edges.remove_edge(&Edge::new(1, 2));
assert!(result.is_ok());
```
