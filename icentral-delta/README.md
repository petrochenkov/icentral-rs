# iCentral-Delta

The `icentral-delta` crate provides advanced tools to efficiently manage and compute biconnected components within graph structures, focusing on adjustments through articulation points and edges utilizing the delta-based method. This implementation enhances traditional approaches to betweenness centrality calculation by providing methods that specifically address the recalculation of centrality metrics when structural changes like edge insertions or deletions occur in dynamic networks.

## Features

The core feature of this crate lies in its ability to accurately maintain and compute biconnected components. Utilizing a delta-based strategy, it minimizes computational overhead during graph updates, making it highly suitable for applications requiring real-time analytics on dynamic graphs.

Key components include:
- **BiconnectedComponentsDelta:** Manages biconnected components with accompanying subgraphs.
- **Betweenness Centrality Computation:** Tools to efficiently recalculate betweenness centrality metrics when graph topology changes.
- **Integration with GraphHash (GH):** Provides an adaptable framework to leverage external graph structures.

## Usage

To integrate the `icentral-delta` crate into your Rust project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-delta = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

Below is a basic example demonstrating how to instantiate a `BiconnectedComponentsDelta` and perform a delta-based update:

```rust
use icentral_delta::{BiconnectedComponentsDelta, FindEdgeBccWithDelta};

// Assume `Graph` implements the required traits.
let mut biconnected_components = BiconnectedComponentsDelta::<Graph>::empty("example_graph");

let node_id: NodeId = ...; // Node ID of interest.
let edge: Edge = ...; // Edge to be evaluated.

// Compute biconnected components with delta.
biconnected_components.find_edge_bcc_with_delta(&mut bcc, &edge).unwrap();
```

It assumes familiarity with graph theories, such as nodes, edges, and biconnected components, and requires implementing traits for custom graph types.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor.
