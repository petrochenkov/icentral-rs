This crate serves as a crucial building block for software solutions requiring highly efficient graph computations.

## Key Features
- **Graph Processing:** Implement complex graph operations with ease using an extensive suite of tools tailored for performance and precision.
- **Performance Optimization:** Employ Rust’s concurrency primitives and zero-cost abstractions for efficient graph computation.
- **Data Structures:** Utilize sophisticated, high-performance data structures to ensure computational tasks are executed with minimal latency and maximum throughput.

## Installation
Add `icentral-test-rustworkx` to your Cargo.toml dependencies:
```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-test-rustworkx = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
```rust
use icentral_test_rustworkx::Graph;

fn main() {
    let mut graph = Graph::new();
    graph.add_node("A");
    graph.add_node("B");
    graph.add_edge("A", "B");

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
