# icentral-cycle

## Overview

The `icentral-cycle` crate provides functionalities for representing and manipulating cycles within a graph. It specializes in calculating the Minimum Cycle Basis (MCB) for a given graph, an essential task in graph theory that aids in various applications such as network design, chemistry, and optimization problems. The Minimum Cycle Basis of a graph is a compact representation of its cycle space, primarily significant for its efficiency in accounting for all the cycles within a graph.

## Features

- **Cycle Representation**: Each cycle is represented as a list of edges, enabling efficient cycle manipulation and evaluation.
- **Minimum Cycle Basis**: Efficiently computes the Minimum Cycle Basis of the graph, providing a foundational analysis tool for further graph algorithms.
- **Edge Indexing**: Access individual edges within a cycle using Rust's index operations, facilitating detailed cycle analysis and operations.
- **Trait Implementations**: Includes implementations of the `NumEdges` trait to quickly access the number of edges and the `CreateEmpty` trait for initializing an empty set of cycles.

## Usage

Include the crate in your `Cargo.toml` dependencies and leverage the interfaces to construct, explore, and analyze cycle bases for graphs.

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-cycle = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

```rust
use icentral_cycle::{Cycle, MinimumCycleBasis};

let basis = MinimumCycleBasis::empty();
let num_cycles = basis.num_cycles();
println!("Number of cycles in the basis: {}", num_cycles);
```

## Safety and Performance

The `icentral-cycle` crate adheres to Rust's safety guarantees, ensuring memory safety and the elimination of common programming bugs such as null pointer dereferencing.

## Contributions

Contributions to the crate are welcome. Please adhere to the standard Rust community guidelines and format your code using Rust's `fmt` tool.
