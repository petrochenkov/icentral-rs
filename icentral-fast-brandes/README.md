# Icentral-Fast-Brandes

## Overview

The `icentral-fast-brandes` crate offers an efficient Rust implementation of computing betweenness centrality using the renowned Brandes algorithm. This metric is pivotal in network analysis, particularly in relation to determining the influence or importance of particular nodes within a graph structure.

Betweenness centrality is computed by assessing the frequency at which a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between other nodes in the graph. This crate streamlines the process, enabling scalable calculations suitable for large graphs and complex structures.

## Features

- **Speed and Efficiency**: Utilizes Brandes algorithm, optimized for performance.
- **Comprehensive Graph Support**: Compatible with any graph structure satisfying the required traits such as `CreateScoresVector` and `NumNodes`.
- **Customizable Workspace**: Leverages `ICentralWorkspace` to dynamically allocate resources during computation.

## Usage

To calculate betweenness centrality with `icentral-fast-brandes`, ensure your graph type fulfills the necessary trait bounds including, but not limited to, `CreateScoresVector`, `Debug`, `NumNodes`, `MappedNodes`, `GetNodeIdRange`, `GetNeighborsForNode`, and `GetEdges`.

Here's an example of how to use the core function:

```rust
use icentral_fast_brandes::fast_brandes_bc;

fn main() -> Result<(), BetweennessCentralityError> {
    let graph = /* initialize your graph data structure here */;
    let scores = fast_brandes_bc(&graph)?;
    println!("Betweenness Centrality Scores: {:?}", scores);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Advanced Concepts

### Brandes Algorithm

The Brandes algorithm efficiently computes the shortest paths and subsequently derives the betweenness centrality by an incremental summation of dependencies. Due to its heavy reliance on Dijkstra's or BFS depending upon the graph's nature (weighted or unweighted), it demonstrates significant advantages in computational efficiency over simpler methods.

## Getting Started

To include `icentral-fast-brandes` in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-fast-brandes = "0.1.0"
```
