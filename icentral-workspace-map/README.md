# ICentral Workspace Map

`icentral-workspace-map` is a Rust crate designed for efficient workspace management within graph systems. It utilizes a `MaybeIndexedMap` to map nodes in a graph to their corresponding workspaces, providing both indexed and non-indexed modes for flexible management.

## Features

- **Efficient Workspace Initialization**: Create empty indexed or mapped workspace collections with ease.
- **Graph Length Management**: Pre-allocate resources for a given graph length, optimizing memory usage and performance.
- **Workspace Manipulation**: Convenient methods for accessing, modifying, and setting workspaces for different graph nodes.
- **Graph Traversal Algorithms**: Supports Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Reverse BFS (RBFS) operations which can be parallelized in future versions.

## Usage

### Creating a WorkspaceMap

To start using the `WorkspaceMap`, initialize it with a desired length and name:

```rust
use icentral_workspace_map::WorkspaceMap;

let workspace_map = WorkspaceMap::new(10, "example_map");
```

### Manipulating Workspaces

- **Check for Workspace**: Determine the existence of a workspace for a node using `has_workspace`.
- **Access Workspace**: Use `workspace_ref` and `workspace_mut` to obtain immutable and mutable references, respectively.
- **Set Workspace**: Directly set a workspace with `set_workspace_for_node`.

### Graph Traversal

Perform BFS and RBFS graph traversal with methods that can be optimized for parallel execution:

```rust
workspace_map.bbfs(None, &component);
workspace_map.bbfs_rbfs(&mut scores, None, &mut component);
```

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
