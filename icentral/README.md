## Getting Started

Add `icentral` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral = "0.1.0"
```

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.rs/icentral) for detailed usage instructions and examples.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.

For progress updates, see the workspacer rust project.
