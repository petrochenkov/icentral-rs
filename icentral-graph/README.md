# icentral-graph

## Overview

`icentral-graph` is a Rust library for advanced manipulation and analysis of undirected graphs. It provides a sophisticated framework for graph algorithms with a focus on minimum union cycles (MUCs), betweenness centrality, and biconnected components.

## Core Concepts

- **Minimum Union Cycle (MUC):** At the heart of the library is the MUC, an intricate data structure to represent cycles within a graph. The library facilitates operations such as constructing, finding, and updating minimum union cycles.
- **Betweenness Centrality:** Utilize algorithms to compute the betweenness centrality, which is crucial for identifying the most pivotal vertices in respect to information flow within the graph.
- **Graph Debugging:** Comprehensive debug utilities to assist in visualizing and diagnosing the state of graph edges and cycles in various forms.

## Key Features

- **Graph Initialization:** Start with `Graph::empty()` to initialize a new graph instance, then populate it via `insert_edge()`.
- **Advanced Debugging Traits:** Leverage traits such as `SetMucDebug` and `GetEdgeListDebugger` for in-depth visualization of graph elements.
- **Efficiency in Graph Operations:** Exploit methods like `find_edge_bcc_with_delta` for efficient exploration and manipulation of graph structures.
- **Connected Components:** Use `find_edge_bcc_with_component` to retrieve articulation points and subgraph sizes linked to these points.
- **MUC-Based Operations:** Seamlessly execute MUC-based algorithms, including construction and exploration of subgraphs derived from MUCs.

## Example Usage

```rust
use icentral_graph::Graph;

fn main() {
    let mut graph = Graph::empty("example_graph");
    graph.init_size(5);
    graph.insert_edge(&Edge::new(0, 1));
    graph.insert_edge(&Edge::new(1, 2));
    println!("Graph with {} edges: {:?}", graph.num_edges(), graph);
}
```
