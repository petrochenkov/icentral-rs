# iCentral Conn Vertex Map

The `icentral-conn-vertex-map` crate offers a sophisticated data structure designed for efficient representation and manipulation of connectivity mappings between nodes in a computational graph. Designed for high-performance applications, it allows developers to manage connectivity using a `ConnVertexMap` which stores and retrieves node-to-node connection information with optimal efficiency.

## Features

- **Efficient Connectivity Management**: Quickly manage connections between nodes with robust methods such as `vertices_for_node`, `set_vertex_map_for_node`, and `clear`.
- **Mutable and Immutable Access**: Seamlessly switch between mutable and immutable data access through methods that either safely reference or mutate node connections.
- **Iterative Access**: Utilize `iter` for traversing connectivity mappings, facilitating streamlined operations over node connections.
- **Flexibility with Indexed and Mapped Modes**: Employ `empty_indexed` or `empty_mapped` constructors to initialize the map in states optimized for specific connectivity scenarios.

## Technical Details

### Storage Structure
At the heart of the `ConnVertexMap` is a `MaybeIndexedMap`, which offers an advanced mapping solution capable of efficient storage and retrieval operations, catering to complex node connectivity patterns.

### API Overview

- **vertices_for_node**: Retrieve a list of connected node IDs for a specific node. 
- **vertices_for_node_mut**: Obtain a mutable reference to node connections, enabling dynamic updates.
- **set_vertex_map_for_node**: Define or redefine the connections for a node, allowing reintegration into the network topology.
- **has_mapping_for_node**: Check existence of a node mapping, aiding in data validation and integrity checks.
- **clear**: Reset the entire connectivity map, invaluable in scenarios requiring quick reinitialization.

## Usage

```rust
use icentral_conn_vertex_map::ConnVertexMap;

fn main() {
    let mut conn_map = ConnVertexMap::empty_indexed("My Graph");
    let node_id = 42;
    let connected_nodes = vec![1, 2, 3];

    conn_map.set_vertex_map_for_node(node_id, connected_nodes);

    if conn_map.has_mapping_for_node(node_id) {
        println!("Node {} is connected to: {:?}", node_id, conn_map.vertices_for_node(node_id));
    }

    conn_map.clear();
    assert!(!conn_map.has_mapping_for_node(node_id));
}
```

## Conclusion

The `icentral-conn-vertex-map` is an essential tool for developers working with graph data structures requiring mutable connectivity mappings. Its methods support robust, efficient, and flexible data operations that are crucial for addressing real-world computational problems in networked environments.
