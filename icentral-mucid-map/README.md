# icentral-mucid-map

The `icentral-mucid-map` crate is designed to provide efficient and reliable mappings between `NodeId` and `MucId`, encapsulated within the `MucIdMap` struct. This crate is implemented with cutting-edge Rust programming features, aspiring to deliver high-performance capabilities for complex applications.

## Features

- **Trait Implementation:** Implements the `GetNodesToMucs` trait, which provides access to the `MucIdMap`.
- **MucIdMap Structure:** A robust data structure that maps `NodeId` to `MucId`, supporting various operations such as iteration, initialization, and reinitialization.
- **Extensible Design:** With traits like `CreateEmptyIndexed`, `CreateEmptyMapped`, `ReinitWithLen`, and `FillWith`, the `MucIdMap` is adaptable for different application requirements.

## Usage Example

To integrate `icentral-mucid-map` into your project, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-mucid-map = "0.1.0"
```

Example usage:

```rust
use icentral_mucid_map::{MucIdMap, GetNodesToMucs};

let mut muc_id_map = MucIdMap::empty_indexed("example_map");
muc_id_map.set_mucid_for_node(node_id, muc_id);
let muc_id = muc_id_map.mucid_for_node(node_id);
```

## Documentation

- **`GetNodesToMucs` Trait:** Ensures access to the internal mappings.
- **`MucIdMap` Struct:** A comprehensive structure with various operations for managing mappings between node IDs and their corresponding minimum union cycle IDs.

## Debugging

This crate employs rigorous debugging (${RUST_LOG_CONTROL}). Detailed logs are generated using `debug!()` for introspecting the operations and transformations during execution. Fine-grained debugging support is available throughout, facilitating easy troubleshooting and performance optimization.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
