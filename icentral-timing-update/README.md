# iCentral-Timing-Update

The `icentral-timing-update` crate provides advanced functionalities for computational graph analysis, with a particular focus on timing updates of betweenness centrality calculations in both static and dynamic graphs. Designed for high performance and scalability, it supports parallel processing using MPI and multithreading.

## Features
- **Dynamic Betweenness Centrality Updates**: Efficiently update betweenness centrality scores when graph edges are inserted or removed.
- **Graph Partitioning**: Utilize biconnected components and other graph algorithms to optimize computation.
- **Random Edge Generation**: Generate random graphs and edge vectors for robust testing.
- **Timed Performance**: Includes detailed timing and speedup analysis with synchronization barriers for precision measurement.

## Usage
```rust
use icentral_timing_update::{TimingUpdateConfig, timing_update_bc};

// Configuration for timing updates
let config = TimingUpdateConfig::default();

// Perform timing update on a set of graphs
let result = timing_update_bc(
    vec!["graph1.g", "graph2.g"],
    10,  // Number of random edges
    42,  // Random seed
    5,   // Number of sources
    Some(CompType::BiconnectedComponent),
    Some(4),  // Number of threads
    Some(Operation::Insertion)
);

match result {
    Ok(_) => println!("Timing update completed successfully."),
    Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {:?}", e),
}
```

## Dependencies
- **MPI Support**: This crate leverages MPI for parallel computation. Ensure your environment is properly configured with an MPI implementation.

## Installation

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
