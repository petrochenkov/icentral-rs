# icentral-parents-map

`icentral-parents-map` provides a robust data structure for managing parent-child relationships between nodes, widely applicable in domains such as graph theory, dependency tracking, and hierarchical systems.

## Features

- **Node Parent Management**: Add, set, and retrieve parents for nodes.
- **Clearance Functions**: Remove all or specific node's parents.
- **Dynamic Structure Initialization**: Flexible methods for initializing and reinitializing structures with different sizes.

## Usage

Integrate this crate to efficiently manage node relationships through a rich API surface encapsulated in Rust traits.

### Public Traits

- `NumParentsForNode`: Retrieve the number of parents for a given node.
- `ParentsForNode`: Obtain the list of parents for a node.
- `ClearParents`, `ClearNodeParents`: Functions to clear parent linkage.
- `SetParentsForNode`, `SetSingleParent`: Set multiple or single parents for nodes.
- `HasParent`: Check if a node has a specified parent.
- `AddParent`: Add a parent to a specific node.

### Example

```rust
use crate::{ParentsMap, NodeId};

fn main() {
    let mut pm = ParentsMap::new(5, "example");
    let node = NodeId(1);
    let parent = NodeId(2);
    pm.set_single_parent(node, parent);
    assert!(pm.has_parent(node, parent));
}
```

### Important Notes
- Utilize `delegate_to_parents` macro for efficient trait delegation.
- Suitable for graph-based implementations with nodes indexed using `NodeId`.
