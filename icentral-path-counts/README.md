# iCentral Path Counts

The `icentral-path-counts` crate offers a dynamic and robust system for managing and computing path counts associated with nodes in a graph-like data structure. This crate is particularly useful for high-performance scenarios where efficient manipulation and retrieval of path count data is critical.

## Overview

At its core, this crate provides the `PathCountForNode` trait and the `PathCounts` struct. These components encapsulate functionality to maintain path count information for nodes effectively, making it a strategic choice for path analysis tasks in graph algorithms or network flow computations.

### Key Concepts

- **PathCountForNode Trait**: Defines the essential operations to access and modify path count data for nodes.
- **PathCounts Struct**: Implements the `PathCountForNode` trait and offers additional methods to increment, set, and compute path counts. It supports initialization variants, such as `empty_indexed`, `empty_mapped`, and with custom lengths.

### Features

- **Incremental Path Updates**: Provides methods for incrementing path counts directly or from another node.
- **Precision Control**: Supports direct manipulation of path count values, including setting them to specific counts or zeroing them.
- **Ratio Computation**: Offers functionality to compute the ratio of path counts between nodes, facilitating comparative analysis.

### Usage

To incorporate this crate in your project, add it to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-path-counts = "0.1.0"
```

For usage, import the crate and utilize the `PathCounts` struct to manage your node path counts:

```rust
use izopath_counts::{PathCounts, PathCountForNode};

let mut path_counts = PathCounts::new(5, "example_counts");
path_counts.increment_path_count_for_node(0, 1);
let count = path_counts.path_count_for_node(0);
```

Advanced users can leverage macros provided by the crate for more complex configurations.
