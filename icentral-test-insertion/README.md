# icentral-test-insertion

`icentral-test-insertion` is a Rust crate designed for efficiently testing and benchmarking edge insertion operations within a graph structure for centrality calculations. The primary focus of this crate is to evaluate the speedup and performance improvements when inserting edges in a graph using novel computational techniques.

## Overview

This crate provides two core functions:

1. **`insertion_test_fuad_hash`:**
   - Purpose: Inserts a specified number of edges into a graph and calculates betweenness centrality, optimizing the Brandes algorithm with hash-based techniques.
   - Returns: Measures such as average speedup and performance statistics.

2. **`insertion_test_fuad_max_iter`:**
   - Purpose: Similar to `insertion_test_fuad_hash`, but allows for iterative executions and detailed speedup analysis across multiple iterations.
   - Returns: Detailed statistics on speedup factors, ideal conditions, and leverages biconnected components for further optimization.

## Features

- **Graph Centrality Optimization:** Utilize advanced hash functions to speed up the calculation of betweenness centrality.
- **Custom Edge Insertion Strategies:** Implement custom edge insertion that iteratively tests performance improvements.
- **Performance Tracking:** Thorough instrumentation for runtime analysis, including idealized speedup predictions.

## How to Use

Implement the graph structure you wish to analyze. Call `insertion_test_fuad_hash` or `insertion_test_fuad_max_iter` with your graph, specifying parameters such as edges to insert:

```rust
let mut graph = Graph::<GraphHash>::new();
let num_edges = 10;
match insertion_test_fuad_hash(&mut graph, num_edges) {
    Ok(_) => println!("Insertion test completed successfully."),
    Err(e) => eprintln!("Error encountered: {:?}", e),
}
```

## Dependencies

This crate depends on the `rand` crate for randomized edge insertion when generating new graph edges.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
