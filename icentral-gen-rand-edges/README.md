# icentral-gen-rand-edges

The `icentral-gen-rand-edges` crate offers robust functionality for generating random edges within graph structures. Designed to operate efficiently within the Rust ecosystem, this crate is particularly useful for simulations and randomized algorithms in graph and network theory.

## Features

- **Random Edge Generation**: Create edges not currently present in a given graph, ensuring no duplicates or self-loops. This is particularly advantageous for testing algorithms that require randomized inputs.
- **Non-Bridge Edge Selection**: Efficiently generate deletions by selecting random edges that are part of the graph yet not bridges. This functionality respects the integrity of the connected components in network analysis.

## Technical Overview

The primary functions of this crate rely on type constraints and traits:
- `gen_rand_edges` uses `NumNodes` and `HasEdge` traits to generate unique edges.
- `gen_rand_edges_deletions` employs `FindBridgeEdges`, `NumEdges`, and `GetEdges` to ensure edges selected are not bridges.

### Example Code

```rust
use icentral_gen_rand_edges::{gen_rand_edges, gen_rand_edges_deletions};
use some_graph_library::{Graph, WyRand};

let mut rng = WyRand::default();
let mut my_graph = Graph::new();
let random_edges = gen_rand_edges(&mut rng, 10, &my_graph).unwrap();
let deletions = gen_rand_edges_deletions(5, &mut my_graph);
```

## Usage

Integrate `icentral-gen-rand-edges` in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-gen-rand-edges = "0.1.0"
```

This crate is designed for those advancing in graph theory, algorithmic design, or network simulations. The functional paradigm, aligned with the 2021 edition of Rust, ensures modern syntax and performance optimizations.
