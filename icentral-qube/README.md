# iCentral-Qube

`icentral-qube` is a Rust library designed for mathematical computation focused on graph theory and network analysis. It provides specialized functionalities to detect shared vertices between cycles within graphs by computing minimum union cycles and leveraging graph hashing interfaces. This crate is targeted at developers and researchers in computational mathematics, particularly those involved in the study of graph structures and their properties.

## Features

- **Graph Cycle Analysis**: Efficiently determine if two cycles share a common vertex within graph structures using the `shared_vertex` function.
- **Minimum Union Cycle Detection**: Identify intersections between a minimum union cycle and another cycle with the `shared_vertex_with_muc_and_cycle` function.

## Technical Background

Graph theory provides foundational computations for determining relationships between nodes and edges, essential for network analysis and mathematical research. This crate utilizes bespoke algorithms to facilitate the identification of intersecting cycles, which is critical in tasks such as network reliability, network flow, and circuit design.

## Installation
Add `icentral-qube` to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-qube = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

```rust
use icentral_qube::{shared_vertex_with_muc_and_cycle, shared_vertex};
// Example usage here
```
