# icentral-bc-mem

icentral-bc-mem offers a robust mechanism for managing memory workspaces through its main structure `BcMemWorkspace`. This crate is oriented for advanced Rust developers who are paving intricate memory layout and manipulation strategies, particularly in scenarios that involve hierarchical node management.

## Features

- **Hierarchy Management:** Handle nested structures efficiently using a vector of vectors for node-level representation, facilitating node additions, deletions, and hierarchical operations.
- **Map-Based Memory Organization:** Implement sophisticated memory handling with `ParentsMap` and `SigmaMap`, leveraging these constructs to organize memory in a configurable way.
- **Interfaces and Functions:** 
  - Dynamically manage named empty workspaces with the `CreateNamedEmpty` implementation.
  - Seamlessly resize memory allocations and access specific node-level information.

## Usage

Integrate `BcMemWorkspace` within your application where memory mapping and node organization are paramount. Use the provided APIs to craft refined hierarchical and memory models.

```rust
use icentral_bc_mem::BcMemWorkspace;
let mut workspace = BcMemWorkspace::empty("workspace1");
workspace.push_level(vec![NodeId::new(1), NodeId::new(2)]);
```

icentral-bc-mem encourages developers to engage with memory layout mechanisms at a fundamental level, potentially benefiting compilers or simulation engines.

## Integration

To integrate `icentral-bc-mem` into your project, update your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
dependencies = {
    icentral-bc-mem = "0.1.0"
}
```
