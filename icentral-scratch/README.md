# icentral-scratch

`icentral-scratch` is a Rust crate designed for developers working with graph-theoretic algorithms that focus on biconnected components and betweenness centrality within complex graph structures. It optimizes the computation of betweenness centrality for nodes by leveraging articulated structures within biconnected components to enhance performance.

Key Features:
- Provides an interface to effectively find, manage and debug biconnected components and articulation points within a graph using the `BiconnectedComponentsScratch` struct.
- Includes robust methods `find_edge_bcc_with_scratch` and `find_edge_bcc_with_scratch_step` for efficient edge-based operations within graph networks.
- Computes betweenness centrality for nodes using an iterative approach, supporting real-world graph sizes with potential articulation.

## Usage
To utilize `icentral-scratch` in your project, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-scratch = "0.1.0"
```
Refer to the trait `FindEdgeBccWithScratch` and struct `BiconnectedComponentsScratch` for primary API functionalities.

## Getting Started
Here is a basic example of how to employ the crate:

```rust
use icentral_scratch::{FindEdgeBccWithScratch, BiconnectedComponentsScratch, BetweennessCentralityError};

fn main() -> Result<(), BetweennessCentralityError> {
    let mut bcc_scratch: BiconnectedComponentsScratch<YourGraphHandler> = BiconnectedComponentsScratch::empty("example_graph");

    // Example node initiation and edges integration
    // ...

    bcc_scratch.compute_bc(&mut scores, Option::None)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

We assume familiarity with Rust and graph theory to maximize the potential of `icentral-scratch`. The library operates seamlessly with any graph representation following the expected trait implementations.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
