# icentral-largest-bcc

`icentral-largest-bcc` is a Rust crate designed to efficiently compute and analyze the largest biconnected components within a graph structure, primarily focusing on centrality metrics in graph theory.

## Overview

The primary feature of this crate is the identification and computation of statistical analysis on the largest biconnected components (BCCs) in a graph. The largest BCC is identified based on the number of nodes, providing metrics essential for applications in graph analytics and network topology assessments.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Identification**: Leveraging advanced graph hashing interfaces, this crate efficiently discovers biconnected components within complex graph structures.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Computes fractions of nodes and edges relative to the entire graph, providing insights into the significance of the components.

## Usage

To employ this crate, instantiate a `Graph` object that conforms to the `BccGraphHashInterface` trait, and utilize the `lbcc_stat` function to derive statistical insights about the largest BCC.

```rust
use icentral_largest_bcc::{LargestBiconnectedComponents, lbcc_stat};

// Suppose you have a mutable graph implementing `BccGraphHashInterface`
let mut graph = /* your graph instantiation */;

if let Ok(_) = lbcc_stat(&mut graph) {
    // Successfully assessed the largest BCC
} else {
    // Handle errors associated with betweenness centrality
}
```

## Advanced Concepts

This crate builds on principles from graph theory, specifically the study of biconnected components which are crucial for understanding redundancy and fail-safe properties in networks.

## Contributing

Contributions to expand the crate's functionality and efficiency optimizations are welcome. The crate operates under the Rust 2021 edition.
