# icentral-node-stack

`icentral-node-stack` is a Rust crate that provides efficient, stack-based data management functionality with traits and implementations tailored for handling `NodeId` structures. It offers a robust interface to maintain and manipulate collections of node identifiers, facilitating operations essential for traversal, modification, and analysis in data structure management.

## Features

- **Node Access and Mutation**: Use `NodeAtIndex` and `SetNodeAtIndex` traits to access and modify nodes at specific indices.
- **Stack Operations**: Built-in support for `push` and `pop`, streamlining operations typical of stack data structures through the `Push` and `Pop` traits.
- **Debug and Clear Capabilities**: Implementations of `CreateNamedEmpty` and `Clear` further enhance the management of node stacks.
- **Custom Macros**: The `delegate_to_bfs_stack!` macro provides extensive capabilities for integrating breadth-first search strategies directly within stack operations.

## Getting Started

To utilize the `icentral-node-stack` crate, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-node-stack = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage Example

```rust
use icentral_node_stack::{NodeIdStack, NodeId, Push, Pop};

fn main() {
    let first_node = NodeId::new(); // Assume NodeId::new() creates a new NodeId
    let mut stack = NodeIdStack::new(first_node, "example");
    
    // Push a new node
    stack.push(NodeId::new());
    
    // Access a node at index
    let node = stack.node_at_index(0);

    // Modify a node at a specific index
    stack.set_node_at_index(0, NodeId::new());

    // Pop a node
    if let Some(popped_node) = stack.pop() {
        println!("Popped node: {:?}", popped_node);
    }
}
```
