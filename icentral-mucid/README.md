# icentral-mucid

`icentral-mucid` is a Rust crate designed for managing identifiers associated with minimum union cycles within graph nodes, offering a straightforward API to access and manipulate these identifiers effectively. 

## Features

- **MucIdForNode Trait**: Provides an interface to retrieve `MinimumUnionCycleId` for a given node using `mucid_for_node`.
- **SetMucIdForNode Trait**: Enables setting a `MinimumUnionCycleId` for a node via `set_mucid_for_node`.
- **Macro Expansion**: Utilize the `mucid!` macro for simplifying repetitive code tasks, enhancing expressiveness and maintaining robustness in your codebase.
- **MinimumUnionCycleId Struct**: Efficient representation of a union cycle identifier, with utilities to manipulate and interact with node identifiers, including implementations for `Display`, and deriving traits such as `Clone`, `Copy`, `PartialEq`, and more.

## Mathematical Foundation

This crate leverages fundamental concepts from discrete mathematics and graph theory, concentrating on minimal cycles, which are pivotal in algorithms that analyze or manipulate graph structures by aiming at optimal intersection points or paths.

## Usage

To utilize the functionalities provided by `icentral-mucid`, import the relevant traits and structures into your Rust project's scope. 

```rust
use icentral_mucid::{MucIdForNode, SetMucIdForNode, MinimumUnionCycleId, mucid};

// Example implementation
struct NodeIdExample;
impl MucIdForNode for NodeIdExample {
    fn mucid_for_node(&self, node: NodeId) -> MinimumUnionCycleId {
        // Implementation details here
    }
}
```

## Installation

Add `icentral-mucid` to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-mucid = "0.1.0"
```
