# icentral-neighbors

`icentral-neighbors` offers a sophisticated framework for graph manipulation operations, including edge handling and node management within neighbor maps, geared towards advanced users building complex graph-based applications.

## Overview

This crate furnishes a robust set of traits and implementations for handling node and edge operations efficiently in graph data structures. Designed specifically for high-performance graph parsing and manipulation, it integrates seamlessly with existing graph representations and offers extensive capability in node and edge manipulation, as well as dynamic graph alterations.

## Key Features

- **Graph Node and Edge Manipulation**: Provides utilities for adding, removing, and unlinking nodes and edges.
- **Customizable Neighbor Structures**: Allows customization of neighbor sets for specific graph nodes.
- **Efficient Graph Initialization and Reinitialization**: Facilitates efficient setup and teardown of graph structures with minimal overhead.
- **Compatibility with Indexed Maps**: Utilizes `MaybeIndexedMap` for enhanced compatibility and performance optimization in managing graph mappings.

## Usage

```rust
use icentral_neighbors::{GetNodes, AddEdge, NeighborsMap};

// Initialize a NeighborsMap
let mut neighbors_map = NeighborsMap::new(6, "MyGraph");

// Add an edge
neighbors_map.add_edge(&Edge { src: 1, dst: 2 });
```

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-neighbors = "0.1.0"
```
