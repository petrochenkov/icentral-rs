# iCentral Distances

## Overview

iCentral Distances is a Rust crate designed to manage and manipulate distances within a graph or network context. The crate implements a `DistanceMap` structure to efficiently store and update node distances, providing utilities for various distance comparisons and manipulations. This is particularly useful for algorithms dealing with pathfinding, graph traversal, or network analysis.

## Features

- **Macro**: `delegate_to_distances!` facilitates ease of use and abstraction in repetitive distance operations.
- **Data Structure**: The `DistanceMap` utilizes an `MaybeIndexedMap<f64>` to store distances associated with nodes in a graph.
- **Convenient Methods**: Includes methods to create, reinitialize and manipulate distance maps, as well as operations for comparing distances between nodes.

## Core Methods

- **Initialization**: `new_from_nodes`, `empty_indexed`, `empty_mapped`, `new` for creating and initializing instances of `DistanceMap`.
- **Comparison**: `v_closer_than_u`, `is_farther_away`, `is_farther_than_one_away`, `is_one_step_away`, functions for comparing node distances.
- **Distance Manipulation**: `set_distance_for_node`, `insert_node_at_infinite_distance`, `set_one_step_away`, `set_zero_distance`, methods for setting or modifying distances.

## Usage Example

```rust
use icentral_distances::DistanceMap;

fn main() {
    let nodes = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    let mut distance_map = DistanceMap::new_from_nodes(nodes, "example_map");
    // Set the distance for a node
    distance_map.set_distance_for_node(1, 5.0);
    // Check if one node is closer than another
    let is_closer = distance_map.v_closer_than_u(2, 3);
    println!("Node 2 is closer to the source than Node 3: {}", is_closer);
}
```

## Advanced Concepts

The `DistanceMap` leverages a flexible distance model which is compatible with both indexed and mapped representations. This adaptability makes it a suitable choice for diverse applications ranging from simple graphs to complex network simulations.
