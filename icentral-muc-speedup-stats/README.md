# icentral-muc-speedup-stats

`icentral-muc-speedup-stats` is a Rust crate designed to provide detailed statistical insights into the speedup optimization of Minimum Uncut (MUC) problems over graph structures. It efficiently summarizes graph parameters and their relation to ideal computational speedup outcomes.

## Overview

The core structure, `MucSpeedupStats`, encapsulates a rich set of metrics:
- **`muc_num_nodes`**: Number of nodes in the MUC.
- **`muc_num_edges`**: Number of edges in the MUC.
- **`graph_len`**: Total number of nodes in the graph.
- **`graph_num_edges`**: Total number of edges in the graph.
- **`ideal_speedup`**: A measure of the potential maximum speedup achievable.
- **`edge_ins_time`**: Duration of edge insertions, in terms of computational time taken.

This crate allows for debugging with a formatted output illustrating crucial ratios, such as node and edge density within the MUC compared to the full graph utilizing Rust's `fmt::Debug` implementation.

## Installation
Add this crate to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:
```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-muc-speedup-stats = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
Below is an example of how to use `MucSpeedupStats`:
```rust
use icentral-muc-speedup-stats::MucSpeedupStats;
use std::time::Duration;

let stats = MucSpeedupStats {
    muc_num_nodes: 50,
    muc_num_edges: 100,
    graph_len: 200,
    graph_num_edges: 400,
    ideal_speedup: 1.5,
    edge_ins_time: Duration::new(2, 0),
};

println!("{:?}", stats);
```

## Technical Background
The `MucSpeedupStats` struct serves to quantify the relationship between a subgraph (MUC) and its corresponding whole graph, facilitating computational analyses based on node and edge densities. It provides a comprehensive snapshot of how a MUC diverges or aligns in terms of size and efficiency potential compared to the broader graph.
