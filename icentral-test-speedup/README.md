# icentral-test-speedup

`icentral-test-speedup` is a Rust crate designed to provide optimized estimates of algorithmic speedup without the assumption that all edges originate from a single biconnected component. This focuses on analyzing and enhancing the efficiency of graph-based computations using edge insertion strategies.

## Features
- **Biconnected Component Analysis**: Utilizes advanced techniques in finding biconnected components essential for accurate speedup estimation.
- **Random Edge Generation**: Injects randomness in edge selection to simulate various graph scenarios.
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed statistical outputs, including mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max speedup estimations, are calculated to inform potential optimizations.

## Usage
Ensure your graph structures implement the `BccGraphHashInterface` trait to utilize `speedup_info`. Refer to the example below:
```rust
use icentral_test_speedup::speedup_info;
// Assuming `MyGraph` is a graph instance implementing `BccGraphHashInterface`
speedup_info(&mut my_graph, num_edges_to_insert);
```

## Mathematical Basis
The crate employs the iterative calculation of pruning counts derived from specific subgraph conditions to estimate computational speedup. It uses graph node and edge counts to determine performance changes upon modifications.

## Requirements
- Rust edition 2021
- Ensure the graph component interfaces correctly with the provided API functions.

## Limitations
Speedup estimates are inherently statistical and should be used as guidelines rather than absolute metrics.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
