# icentral-subgraph-map

`icentral-subgraph-map` is a Rust crate designed for efficient and robust management of subgraph mappings. Leveraging the power of the `MaybeIndexedMap` data structure and the Pareto-efficient use of computational resources, this crate allows users to dynamically associate and manipulate subgraphs with nodes in a graph structure.

## Overview

The primary structure, `SubGraphMap`, provides an interface to manage subgraphs tied to specific graph nodes. Utilizing the capability of Rust's type system, this crate ensures safety and concurrency through the pervasive use of `Arc` to enable multiple ownership scenarios when associating a subgraph with a node.

## Core Functionality
- **set_subgraph_map_for_node:** Establishes a subgraph mapping for a given node.
- **subgraph_for_node:** Retrieves the subgraph associated with a specific node.
- **clear:** Removes all existing mappings, resetting the structure.
- **has_mapping_for_node:** Checks if a node has an existing subgraph mapping.
- **iter:** Provides an iterator over the subgraph mappings.
- **empty_indexed / empty_mapped:** Constructs a new `SubGraphMap` with specified indexing versatility.

## Example Usage
```rust
use icentral_subgraph_map::SubGraphMap;
use std::sync::Arc;

let mut graph_map = SubGraphMap::empty_indexed("example_map");
let subgraph_data = Arc::new(/* your subgraph data */);
graph_map.set_subgraph_map_for_node(node_id, subgraph_data.clone());

if graph_map.has_mapping_for_node(node_id) {
    let subgraph = graph_map.subgraph_for_node(node_id);
    // utilize `subgraph`
}

graph_map.clear();
```

This guide offers an insight into how the `icentral-subgraph-map` crate operates, enabling developers to manage node-subgraph relationships effectively. Readers should have a cursorily understanding of Rust's concurrency models, if simultaneous operations on graph data are intended.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
