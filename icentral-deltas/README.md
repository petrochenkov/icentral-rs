# icentral-deltas

`icentral-deltas` is a Rust crate that provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for managing delta changes in data structures using a concept of delta mapping. This library is highly suitable for applications requiring dynamic and efficient updates to datasets, leveraging memory-efficient designs through the use of `MaybeIndexedMap`.

## Features

- **Delta Management**: Facilitates efficient tracking, updating, and resetting of deltas in a dataset using the core abstraction provided by `DeltaMap`.
- **Custom Macros**: Includes `delegate_to_deltas`, a macro designed to streamline interactions with delta-based data, allowing for concise code structures.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Supports operations like clearing the dataset, incrementally updating values, and computing ratios. These functionalities enable robust manipulation of datasets that evolve over time.

## Core Structures

### `DeltaMap`
A pivotal construct in `icentral-deltas`, `DeltaMap` is equipped with several methods:
- Creation functions like `empty_indexed`, `empty_mapped`, and `new` for initializing `DeltaMap` objects with different presets.
- Update methods including `update`, `set_zero`, `set_one`, allowing precise control over delta states.
- Utility functions such as `clear`, `len`, `get`, and `set` offer direct interactions with map contents.

## Usage Example
Here is a brief illustration of how `DeltaMap` can be utilized:

```rust
use icentral_deltas::DeltaMap;

// Create a new `DeltaMap`
let mut delta_map = DeltaMap::new(10, "example_map");

delta_map.update(1, 2, 0.5);
let ratio = delta_map.ratio(1, 2);
println!("Computed ratio: {}", ratio);
```

## Installation
Add this crate to your dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-deltas = "0.1.0"
```
