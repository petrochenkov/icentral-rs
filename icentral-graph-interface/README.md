# iCentral Graph Interface

`icentral-graph-interface` is a robust Rust crate structured to empower developers working with graph structures and implementing graph-theoretic algorithms. This crate provides traits that abstract functionalities related to graph traversal, pathfinding, and the management of complex graph-based data structures, and is specifically oriented towards tasks involving Minimum Union Cycles and Betweenness Centrality, among other complex computations.

## Features

- **Graph Validation**: Utilize `IsValid` to ascertain graph correctness.
- **Minimum Cycle Basis Identification**: Employ `McbFind` to find algorithmically relevant cycles.
- **Iterative Debugger**: Use `InitDebugIteration` and `DebugIterationStep` for detailed iteration debugging.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Apply `FindSingleSourceShortestPaths` for efficient shortest path calculations.
- **Distance Mapping**: Leverage `CreateDistanceMaps` to generate comprehensive distance maps.
- **Betweenness Centrality**: Initialize with `InitBetweennessCentrality` for advanced centrality analysis.
- **Graph Connectivity**: Analyze connected components and pruning with `GetConnectedComponentSizes` and `FindPruningCounts`.

## Installation

Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
icentral-graph-interface = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Implement the desired traits in a struct managing your graph data:

```rust
use icentral_graph_interface::{IsValid, McbFind, PrintHeader};

struct MyGraph;

impl IsValid for MyGraph {
    fn is_valid(&self) -> bool {
        // Implement logic to validate graph
        true
    }
}

impl McbFind for MyGraph {
    fn mcb_find(&self) {
        // Implement logic to find minimum cycle basis
    }
}

impl PrintHeader for MyGraph {
    fn print_header(&self) {
        // Logic to print graph header
    }
}
```
