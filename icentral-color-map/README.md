# iCentral Color Map

The `icentral-color-map` crate provides an efficient mechanism for representing, manipulating, and accessing color mapping for nodes in computational graphs or similar structures. This library is designed for high-performance applications requiring dynamic manipulation of node attributes, specifically node coloration.

## Key Features
- **Color Enum:** Effortlessly manage node states utilizing the `Color` enum, which currently supports two distinct states: `None` and `Grey`. Additional states can be integrated to extend functionality.
- **ColorMap Struct:** Constitutes a robust map structure containing node color data, underpinned by the `MaybeIndexedMap`. This struct offers numerous utilities for color manipulation and query.
- **Custom Formatting:** Implements the `fmt::Display` trait for clear and human-readable node color output.
- **Versatile Construction:** Provides multiple methods to instantiate color maps, including `empty_indexed`, `empty_mapped`, and initialization from existing nodes with `new_from_nodes`.
- **Efficient Node Operations:** Includes convenience functions to efficiently set node colors, check if a node is colored, retrieve colors, and reinitialize maps.

## Usage
Assume you have a list of nodes for which you want to initialize a color map:
```rust
use icentral_color_map::{ColorMap, Color};

// Initialize with nodes
let nodes = vec![NodeId(1), NodeId(2), NodeId(3)];
let mut color_map = ColorMap::new_from_nodes(nodes, "ExampleColorMap");

// Set node color
color_map.set_color_for_node_grey(NodeId(1));

// Check if node is colored
if color_map.is_colored(NodeId(1)) {
    println!("Node 1 is colored grey");
}
```
Advanced implementations can push the boundaries further by extending the permitted states of the `Color` enum or integrating this crate with larger centralized graph-processing systems.
