# icentral-articulation-point

`icentral-articulation-point` is a sophisticated Rust crate that provides an efficient implementation for identifying articulation points within a graph. Articulation points, also known as cut vertices, are crucial in understanding the vulnerability of networked systems as their removal increases the number of connected components in a graph.

## Features
- **Efficient Articulation Point Detection**: Leverages depth-first search strategies for determining articulation points.
- **Robust Context Management**: Utilizes an internal context to manage traversal state, predicated on `ColorMap`, `DistanceMap`, and `PredecessorMap` for stateful execution.
- **Practical Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error management utilizing `BetweennessCentralityError` for resilience in complex computations.

## Traits and Methods

### `FindArticulationPoints`
This trait defines the core methods for articulation point detection:
- `fn find_articulation_points(&self, out_vec: &mut Vec<NodeId>)`: Initiates the discovery of articulation points and stores them in the provided vector.
- `fn articulation_point_dfs_visitor(...)`: A recursive helper performing depth-first search to locate articulation points.
- `fn articulation_point_dfs_visitor_step_tree_edge(...)`: Manages tree-edge transitions during DFS traversal.

### Structures
- `ArticulationPointFinderContext<'a>`: Manages traversal metadata and state, indispensable for articulation point computation.

## Usage
Add this crate to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-articulation-point = "0.1.0"
```
Implement `FindArticulationPoints` for your graph type, ensuring that it accommodates graph-related traits such as `NumNodes` and `GetNeighborsForNode`.
