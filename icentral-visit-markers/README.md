# iCentral Visit Markers

`icentral-visit-markers` is a Rust crate designed for efficient manipulation and tracking of graph traversal states, especially useful in algorithms involving graph exploration, such as depth-first or breadth-first search. The crate provides a robust mechanism to maintain node visitation states, encapsulating them in a structured and flexible manner.

## Features

- **Visit Tracking:** Efficiently track whether specific nodes within a graph are visited, supporting both indexed and mapped structures for storage flexibility.
- **Macro Support:** Utilizes macros to streamline the delegation of functionalities related to marker operations.
- **Flexible Initialization:** Instantiate marker sets from given nodes, with customizable initial visited states.
- **Comprehensive API:** Includes methods for marking nodes as visited/unvisited, iterating over unvisited nodes, and reinitializing marker sets.
- **Debugging Outputs:** Debug level logs provide insights during development and computation, aiding in understanding and optimizing graph traversal processes.

## Getting Started

To start using `icentral-visit-markers` in your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-visit-markers = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage Example

```rust
use icentral_visit_markers::VisitMarkers;

let nodes = vec![NodeId(1), NodeId(2), NodeId(3)];
let mut markers = VisitMarkers::new_from_nodes(nodes, "example_markers");

markers.visit(NodeId(1));

assert!(markers.visited(NodeId(1)));
assert!(!markers.visited(NodeId(2)));

let unvisited_nodes = markers.iter_unvisited();
```
