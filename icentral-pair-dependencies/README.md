# icentral-pair-dependencies

### Overview

`icentral-pair-dependencies` is a Rust crate designed to manage and compute pair dependencies within a defined set of nodes. It provides a structured approach to dynamically set, update, and retrieve dependency values through a set of comprehensive APIs, thereby supporting complex dependency management scenarios, particularly in graph analytics or network evolution.

### Features

- **Trait: `PairDependencyForNode`**: An interface for retrieving pair dependency values for a specified node.
- **Trait: `SetPairDependencyForNode`**: An interface for setting pair dependency values for a specified node.
- **Struct: `PairDependencies`**: Manages dependency data for nodes utilizing `MaybeIndexedMap<f64>`, supporting efficient queries and updates.
- **Macros**: Facilitate delegation and simplification of debugging and dependency settings.

### Struct Implementation

- **`PairDependencies`**: Offers a range of methods for creating and manipulating node dependencies:
  - `empty_indexed()`, `empty_mapped()`: Initializes with specified parameters.
  - `new()`: Constructs with a given length and initializes dependencies.
  - `fill()`: Uniformly assigns a dependency value across nodes.
  - `increment_pair_dependency_for_node()`: Atomically increases dependency for a node.
  - `update()`: Custom logic for incremental updates based on adjacent node interactions.  
  - `reinit()`: Reinitializes length and dependencies to predefined start condition.

### Logging and Debugging

Robust logging is integrated via debug constructs, ensuring informative outputs during development and troubleshooting sessions for each method invocation.

### Getting Started

Add this crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-pair-dependencies = "0.1.0"
```

Import into your Rust code:

```rust
use icentral-pair_dependencies::{PairDependencies, PairDependencyForNode};
```

### Examples

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut pd = PairDependencies::new(5, "example");
    pd.set_pair_dependency_for_node(1, 0.42);
    let dependency = pd.pair_dependency_for_node(1);
    println!("Dependency for node 1: {}", dependency);
}
```
