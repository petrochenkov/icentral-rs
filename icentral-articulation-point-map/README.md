# iCentral Articulation Point Map

The `icentral-articulation-point-map` crate provides efficient data structures and algorithms for managing and querying articulation points within graph topologies. This is particularly useful in fields like computer science and network analysis, where articulation points play a critical role in understanding graph connectivity and vulnerability.

## Overview

Articulation points, or cut vertices, are vertices in a graph that, when removed, increase the number of connected components of the graph. The `icentral-articulation-point-map` crate provides functionality to manage, analyze, and compute products of subgraph micentraltudes through such points.

## Key Structures

- **`ArticulationPointMap`**: The central structure of this crate, enabling operations such as creating empty maps, adding articulation points, checking connectivity, and computing related metrics.
  
- **`SubGraphMicentraltudeDebugProduct`**: A debugging utility used for tracking the product of micentraltudes across articulation points.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Handling**: Utilize `MaybeIndexedMap` for versatile mapping of articulation points, supporting both indexed and mapped configurations.

- **Debugging Utilities**: Comprehensive debugging features leveraging Rust's macro capabilities to trace computation steps.

- **Graph Analysis**: Functions to compute micentraltude, analyze graph sub-structures through articulation points, and manage node interactions effectively.

## Usage

Ensure you include this crate in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-articulation-point-map = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

```rust
use icentral_articulation_point_map::ArticulationPointMap;

let mut map = ArticulationPointMap::new(10, "TestMap");
map.map_articulation_point(1, &vec![5, 3, 2]);

let has_both = map.has_both_articulation_points(1, 2);
let micentraltude = map.subgraph_micentraltude_through_articulation_point(1);
println!("Does the map have both points? {}", has_both);
println!("Micentraltude: {}", micentraltude);
```

## Conclusion

The `icentral-articulation-point-map` provides robust tools for graph analysis through articulation points, offering flexibility in data structure choices and a variety of utility functions to streamline your graph-related computations.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor.
