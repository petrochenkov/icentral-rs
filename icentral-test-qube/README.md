# Icentral Test Qube

The `icentral-test-qube` crate is a specialized toolkit for analyzing and optimizing dynamic graph structures. It provides advanced algorithms for betweenness centrality with a focus on enhancing computational efficiency through Minimum Union Cycles (MUCs). 

This crate is particularly suited for handling the insertion of edges in graphs and recalculating centrality metrics dynamically.

## Key Concepts

### Minimum Union Cycles (MUCs)
MUCs are a structural property that provide insights into graph connectivity and can optimize the recalculation of centralities during edge insertions.

### Betweenness Centrality
A critical metric in network analysis, used to determine the importance of nodes within the topology. This crate focuses on incremental updates to betweenness scores, thereby reducing computational overhead compared to recomputing from scratch.

## Core Functions
- **`insertion_test_qube_step`**: Insert a specified edge into the graph, updating MUCs and recalculating betweenness centrality for a minimally updated set of nodes.
- **`insertion_test_qube`**: Perform a bulk insertion test, evaluating the computational efficiency of edge insertions on betweenness centrality updates.
- **`exp_qube_p` Functions**: Perform experimental speedup analysis of betweenness centrality updates for predefined sets of random edges.

### Usage
The crate provides key algorithms that assume knowledge of underlying graph structures and edge/node operations. Users with intuition about graph theory and network analysis will find this crate especially proficient in enhancing graph analysis workflows.

```rust
use icentral_test_qube::insertion_test_qube;

let mut graph = ...; // graph initialization code
let num_edges = Some(100);
insertion_test_qube(&mut graph, num_edges)?;
```
