# iCentral Predecessor Map

`icentral-predecessor-map` is a Rust crate designed for graph data processing, offering an optimized implementation of a predecessor map.

## Overview

A `PredecessorMap` is an essential component in graph algorithms, commonly used for tracking the traversal paths within a graph structure. This particular implementation uses a `MaybeIndexedMap` to hold node relationships efficiently, supporting dynamic graph operations while ensuring a streamlined association between nodes and their predecessors.

## Key Features

- Create indexed or mapped predecessor maps, facilitating flexible data handling.
- Determine node relationships, such as predecessors and root status within a tree.
- Efficiently reinitialize map structures to adapt to changing graph sizes or structures.
- Useful in implementing graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's, Prim's, and BFS/DFS.

## Usage

### Creating a New Map

To create a new `PredecessorMap` instance, specify the nodes and a descriptive name:

```rust
let nodes = vec![NodeId::new(1), NodeId::new(2)];
let predecessor_map = PredecessorMap::new_from_nodes(nodes, "GraphPredecessorMap");
```

### Modifying Map Data

You can set a predecessor for a specific node or check if a node is a tree root using:

```rust
predecessor_map.set_predecessor_for_node(NodeId::new(1), NodeId::new(2));
let is_root = predecessor_map.is_tree_root(NodeId::new(1));
```

### Operations

- `empty_indexed` and `empty_mapped` are constructors to create maps without predefined node relations.
- `reinit` allows you to reset the map with new capacities.

## Why Use iCentral Predecessor Map?

This crate offers well-optimized operations essential for large-scale applications, providing requisite utilities in network analysis, dependency resolution, and beyond.
