# icentral-test-fuad

**icentral-test-fuad** is a Rust library designed for efficient graph processing, specifically focusing on the computation of approximate Betweenness Centrality via an experimental algorithm leveraging Biconnected Components (BCCs). This crate targets computationally intensive graph analyses, making it optimal for large-scale application in network science or complex systems analysis.

## Features
- Implements a high-performance algorithm for Betweenness Centrality using Brandes' method combined with BCC estimation.
- Provides efficient graph updates through inserted edge operations, minimizing recomputation costs.
- Optimized for concurrent execution, making it suitable for large graphs with dynamic topologies.

## Installation
To use **icentral-test-fuad**, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-test-fuad = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
The library provides a function `exp_fuad_p` enabling Betweenness Centrality updates on dynamic graphs:

```rust
use icentral_test_fuad::exp_fuad_p;

let mut graph = Graph::new();
let edges = vec![Edge::new(1, 2), Edge::new(2, 3)];
let brandes_time = Duration::new(1, 0);

exp_fuad_p(&mut graph, Some(10), &edges, brandes_time);
```

## Concepts

### Biconnected Components
The algorithm computes Betweenness Centrality by leveraging BCCs of the graph, facilitating improved accuracy and performance especially when edges are dynamically added.

### Betweenness Centrality (BC)
A key metric in network analysis, BC quantifies the importance of nodes as bridges of information in a network topology.

### Algorithmic Approach
- Utilizes Brandes' algorithm as a foundational method.
- Enhances computational efficiency through an experimental iterative process tailored for dynamic graph changes, maintaining accuracy while reducing computational cost.

## Advanced Configuration
- `num_iter`: Configure the number of iterations for edge processing. Optimize based on graph dynamics and computational constraints.
