# icentral-test-brandes

`icentral-test-brandes` is a Rust crate designed for efficiently calculating betweenness centrality using Brandes' algorithm. This crate provides high-performance methods for processing graph structures, allowing users to compute centrality metrics which are imperative for understanding the influence of each node within a network.

## Features

- **Iterative Betweenness Calculation**: Supports both bounded and all iterations for flexibility in performance tuning.
- **Comprehensive Timing**: Precisely measures computation duration, making it valuable for benchmarking and performance analysis.

## Functionality

### `exp_brandes_p`
Executes the Brandes centrality algorithm on a given graph, with support for either a defined number of iterations or all possible iterations. Current implementation notes on `max_time` parameter demonstrate ongoing enhancements.

### `exp_brandes_p_all_iterations`
Performs the centrality calculations across all possible iterations, leveraging the complete node set within the graph.

### `exp_brandes_p_bounded_iterations`
Optimizes the calculation process by restricting the number of iterations, beneficial for larger graphs with performance constraints.

## Usage

1. Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    icentral-test-brandes = "0.1.0"
    ```

2. Use the functions in your Rust code, analyzing graph structures to determine the influence of nodes.
