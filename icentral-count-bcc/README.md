# icentral-count-bcc

`icentral-count-bcc` is a robust and efficient Rust library designed to facilitate the analysis of graph structures, specifically focusing on the biconnected components (BCC) within a given graph. This crate provides functionality to count the number of biconnected components that meet or exceed a specific edge threshold, thereby aiding in detailed graph analysis and network connectivity studies.

## Overview

A biconnected component of a graph is a maximal biconnected subgraph. Such components are vital in graph theory and network reliability analysis as their removal can significantly disrupt the connectivity of the graph. The `icentral-count-bcc` crate helps identify how connected a graph structure is by determining its biconnected components.

## Features

- Identifies and counts biconnected components within a graph.
- Computes components based on a specified minimum number of edges.
- Offers utilities for detailed component size analysis and reporting.
- Integrates logging for advanced debugging and analysis.

## Usage

To leverage the utility provided by `icentral-count-bcc`, a user must implement or use types conforming to specific interfaces required by the main counting functionality.

```rust
use icentral_count_bcc::count_bcc;

let mut graph = ...; // Initialize your graph structure here
let min_edges = 5;
let result = count_bcc(&mut graph, min_edges);

match result {
    Ok(_) => println!("Biconnected component count successful"),
    Err(e) => eprintln!("An error occurred: {:?}", e),
}
```

The function `count_bcc` expects the graph to implement several traits, such as `PrintHeader`, `NumEdges`, and `FindBiconnectedComponent`, which are crucial for operating within this framework.

## Requirements

This crate is built upon the 2021 edition of Rust, ensuring compatibility with the latest features and language enhancements.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
