# icentral-operation

## Overview

The `icentral-operation` crate provides an enumerative representation of fundamental operations: `Insertion` and `Deletion`. Designed with simplicity and performance in mind, this library is ideal for any system that requires robust handling of these operations, such as database engines, text editors, or command-line interfaces.

## Features

- **Enums for Operations**: Clearly defined `Insertion` and `Deletion` operations using Rust enums.
- **Trait Implementations**: Derived traits like `Copy`, `Clone`, `Default`, `Debug`, `PartialEq`, and `Eq` ensure seamless integration into applications requiring cloning and comparison of operations.
- **Utility Methods**: Method implementations such as `is_deletion()` and `is_insertion()` offer quick checks on the operation types.

## Usage

To employ `icentral-operation` in your project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-operation = "0.1.0"
```

Here is a simple example to get started:

```rust
use icentral_operation::Operation;

fn process_operation(op: Operation) {
    if op.is_insertion() {
        println!("Performing insertion operation");
    } else if op.is_deletion() {
        println!("Performing deletion operation");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let insert_op = Operation::Insertion;
    let delete_op = Operation::Deletion;

    process_operation(insert_op);
    process_operation(delete_op);
}
```

## Safety and Performance

This crate benefits from Rust's ownership system, guaranteeing memory safety and preventing data races. Optimized for performance, `icentral-operation` leverages Rust's zero-cost abstractions to minimize runtime overhead.
