# iCentral Sigmas

`icentral-sigmas` is a Rust library designed to efficiently manage and manipulate sigma values associated with graph nodes. It provides a robust infrastructure for setting, getting, updating, and computing ratios of sigma values, with a focus on performance and precision.

This crate is particularly useful in scenarios involving graph-based data structures where sigma calculations are necessary - such as simulations, optimizations, scientific computations, and other applications requiring node-centric analyses.

## Features

- **Trait-based Interfaces**: Define standardized functionality for setting and getting sigma values.
  ```rust
  pub trait GetSigmaValueForNode {
      fn sigma_value_for_node(&self, node: NodeId) -> f64;
  }

  pub trait SetSigmaValueForNode {
      fn set_sigma_value_for_node(&mut self, node: NodeId, val: f64);
  }
  ```

- **SigmaMap Structure**: A comprehensive structure that implements these traits and provides a plethora of methods to manipulate sigma values.

- **Macro Support**: Use the `delegate_to_sigmas!` macro for delegating functionalities to sigma value operations conveniently.

## Usage

To include `icentral-sigmas` in your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies section:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-sigmas = "0.1.0"
```

### Examples

Create a new `SigmaMap` and manipulate sigma values:
```rust
let mut sigma_map = SigmaMap::new(10, "ExampleMap");
sigma_map.set_sigma_value_for_node(1, 2.5);
println!("Sigma value for node 1: {}", sigma_map.sigma_value_for_node(1));
```

### Updating Sigma Values
Use the `update` method for complex updates based on the sigma values of two nodes and a multiplier:
```rust
sigma_map.update(2, 3, 1.2);
```

### Ratio Calculations
Compute the ratio of sigma values between two nodes:
```rust
let ratio = sigma_map.ratio(4, 5);
println!("Sigma ratio: {}", ratio);
```
