# icentral-timer

`icentral-timer` is a highly efficient Rust-based crate designed to accurately measure the time interval between two events. It leverages the system's high-resolution clock to provide precise timing capabilities, making it ideal for performance-sensitive applications in various domains.

## Overview

The core component is the `Timer` struct, encapsulating timing logic with an elegant, minimalistic interface. Utilizing Rust's `RefCell` and `Instant`, the `Timer` ensures both mutability and thread safety, allowing for versatility in concurrent applications.

### Timer Struct

- **start:** Implements the high-resolution starting point for measurement.
- **stop:** Records the precise moment of stopping, permitting multiple readings.

### Usage

- **start():** Initiates timing, marked by the current instant.
- **stop():** Concludes timing, determining the interval.
- **interval():** Computes the duration between start and stop, returning a `Duration` object.

### Example
```rust
use icentral_timer::Timer;

let mut timer = Timer::default();
timer.start();
// Perform some operations here
let duration = timer.interval();
println!("Elapsed time: {:?}", duration);
```

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-timer = "0.1.0"
```

## Why Use icentral-timer?
- **Precision:** Optimized for high-resolution timing.
- **Simplicity:** Intuitive API minimizes boilerplate code.
- **Concurrency Safety:** Suited for multi-threaded environments.
