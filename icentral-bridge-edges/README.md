# icentral-bridge-edges

## Overview

`icentral-bridge-edges` is a Rust crate designed to identify and extract bridge edges from graph structures. It employs the algorithmic concept of biconnected components to efficiently determine these critical edges within a graph. This crate is particularly useful in network analysis and graph theory applications where connectivity and failure analysis are paramount.

## Features

- **Trait Implementation**: `FindBridgeEdges` trait provides a seamless interface for finding bridge edges, which are edges that, when removed, increase the number of connected components in a graph.
- **Efficient Algorithm**: Utilizes the art and science of biconnected component (BCC) identification to isolate bridge edges, ensuring performance efficiency.
- **Graph Theory Application**: Ideal for applications requiring robustness and connectivity analysis of network graphs.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the `icentral-bridge-edges` crate:

```rust
use icentral_bridge_edges::FindBridgeEdges;

// Assuming `Graph` implements `FindBiconnectedComponent` 
let mut graph = Graph::new();
let bridge_edges = graph.find_bridge_edges();
println!("Bridge Edges: {:?}", bridge_edges);
```

This example demonstrates instantiating a graph and utilizing the `find_bridge_edges` method to extract bridge edges.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-bridge-edges = "0.1.0"
```

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
