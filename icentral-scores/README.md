# iCentral Scores

`icentral-scores` is a Rust crate designed for calculating and managing betweenness centrality scores within network graphs. Betweenness centrality is a measure of a node's importance based on the number of shortest paths that pass through it within a network. This crate provides mechanisms to efficiently compute, update, and manage these scores to facilitate high-performance graph analysis.

## Features

- **Flexible Score Calculation:** Supports generating betweenness scores from a graph reference or specific node identifiers.
- **Dynamic Score Updates:** Offers methods to incrementally adjust scores for individual nodes, allowing for real-time graph analysis.
- **Efficient Data Structures:** Utilizes `MaybeIndexedMap` to store and manage betweenness scores effectively with features like halving values or clearing all scores.

## Core Components

### Traits

- **CreateScoresVector:** Implement this trait to generate a vector of betweenness scores.
- **SpawnScores:** Use this for spawning or initializing scores in a custom manner.
- **BrandesIterUpdatePairDependenciesAndFill:** Facilitates updating scores based on the Brandes iterative method, a well-known algorithm for computing betweenness centrality.

### Structs

- **BetweennessScores:** The central structure that holds, manages, and operates on node scores. It can be initialized from graphs or node ids and provides utilities for score manipulation.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-scores = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

To start using `icentral-scores`, implement the provided traits in your application to handle betweenness score calculations and adjustments. Here is an example:

```rust
use icentral_scores::{BetweennessScores, CreateScoresVector};

fn main() {
    // Example initialization of scores
    let scores = BetweennessScores::new_from_graph_ref(&graph, "example_scores");
    // Manipulate and access scores as needed
}
```

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
