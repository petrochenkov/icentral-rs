# iCentral-Mock

The `icentral-mock` crate provides mock structures to facilitate testing and prototyping of graph-related applications. This crate implements a basic enumeration, `GraphMock`, to represent various predefined graph structures that can be filled into custom graph implementations using traits like `ConnectNodeIds` and `InitWithSize`.

## Use Cases
`icentral-mock` is designed as a utility for developers looking to simulate graph topologies in Rust-based systems. It allows the construction and evaluation of graph algorithms, configuration of node connections, and initialization with arbitrary data structures.

### Key Components

- **GraphMock Enum:** This enum includes three primary variants - `PaperZero`, `Paper`, and `Basic`, each representing different mock graph structures with predefined node connections.

- **Named Trait Implementation:** Each `GraphMock` variant is associated with a name, enhancing usability when integrating with complex systems.

- **Graph Population Functionality:** Through the `fill` method, `GraphMock` instances can populate given graph data structures with sample topology, facilitating testing or demonstration of behavior under said connectivity.

### Example Usage
```rust
use icentral_mock::{GraphMock, ConnectNodeIds, InitWithSize};

let mut graph = YourGraphType::new();
GraphMock::Paper.fill(&mut graph);
// Now the graph is populated with the predefined topology of the Paper pattern.
```

## Technical Details
The crate emphasizes modularity and ease of integration with existing graph libraries by stipulating generic interfaces. Developers can use it to validate graph-theoretic constructs such as connectivity and pathfinding in controlled mock environments without actual data dependencies.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor.
