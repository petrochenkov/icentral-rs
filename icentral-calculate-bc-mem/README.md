# icentral-calculate-bc-mem

## Overview

`icentral-calculate-bc-mem` is an advanced Rust crate designed to perform efficient betweenness centrality computations in dynamic graph structures. Focused on memory optimization and incremental updates, this library facilitates the sophisticated manipulation of graph components to efficiently update the betweenness scores with minimal computational overhead.

## Features

- Perform incremental betweenness centrality calculation for subgraphs, efficiently updating the scores as edges are added or modified.
- Memory-efficient operations with structures for `BcMemWorkspace` facilitating optimal resource usage.
- Parallel processing support through synchronization mechanisms like `Arc` and `Mutex`.
- Graph structures and algorithms are designed for high-performance computations, suitable for large-scale graphs.

## Example Usage

```rust
use icentral_calculate_bc_mem::{update_bc_mem, construct_queue_for_bc_increment_computation};
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

// Assuming `graph` is a pre-defined graph structure
// `bc_mem` and `scores` are betweenness centrality memory and score structures
// `edge` represents the edge being assessed

if let Err(e) = update_bc_mem(&mut bc_mem, &mut scores, &graph, edge, &mut workspaces) {
    eprintln!("Error updating BC memory: {:?}", e);
}
```

## Technical Details

- **Graph Handling**: Employs `Graph<GH>` with generic constraints supporting mapped nodes and node ID range management.
- **Concurrency**: Utilizes safe concurrency patterns with Rust's ownership and lifetime guarantees.
- **Memory Management**: Designed to efficiently handle memory reallocations and workspace management, ensuring optimized betweenness centrality calculations.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-calculate-bc-mem = "0.1.0"
```
