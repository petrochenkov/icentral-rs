# icentral-test-largest-bcc-speedup

`icentral-test-largest-bcc-speedup` is a Rust crate that provides functionality to estimate potential speedups achieved by focusing on the largest biconnected component (LBCC) in a graph. The central insight of this crate is that by analyzing one of the largest biconnected components, we can potentially deduce more efficient computational strategies that result in significant runtime improvements when handling large graph datasets.

## Functionality

### `speedup_info_lbcc`
This function calculates metrics and estimates speedups by examining how many nodes and edges are present in the largest biconnected component of a given graph. Through statistical analysis of randomized potential edge insertions, it can estimate the computational speedup that might be realized if computations focus on this central graph component.

Key statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation speedups are evaluated and displayed within a debug context to allow developers to understand the potential efficiency.

## Usage
To effectively employ this crate:
1. Include the crate in your `Cargo.toml` dependencies.
2. Use `speedup_info_lbcc` by passing a graph (wrapped in `Arc<Mutex<Graph<GraphHash>>>`) and specify the number of edges to simulate inserting.
3. Interpret the debug output for statistical insights on potential speedups.

### Example
```rust
use icentral_test_largest_bcc_speedup::speedup_info_lbcc;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

// Assume `graph` is a pre-constructed Arc<Mutex<Graph<GraphHash>>> instance.
let result = speedup_info_lbcc(graph, 100);
```

## Dependencies
- [rand](https://crates.io/crates/rand) for generating random numbers used in edge insertions.
