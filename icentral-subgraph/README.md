# icentral-subgraph

`icentral-subgraph` is a Rust library designed to facilitate efficient management and computation of subgraphs within a broader graph context, with a primary focus on betweenness centrality metrics. It leverages specific algorithmic structures to compute shortest paths, manage node connectivity, update dependency metrics, and more, through a rich set of traits and methods defined within the `SubGraph` structure.

## Features
- **SubGraph Representation:** Manage and manipulate graph subsets using `SubGraph` and associated utilities.
- **Betweenness Centrality:** Efficiently calculate betweenness centrality metrics for nodes using specialized algorithms.
- **Path Management:** Handle path calculations, including updating pair dependencies and sigma values.
- **BFS Algorithms:** Implement BFS techniques for graph traversal and marking nodes.
- **Edge Management:** Insert and remove edges, ensuring dynamic updates to the graph structure.

## Concepts and Usage

### Core Traits:
- `MucComputeNewPathCountsAndPaths`: Define operations for computing new path counts based on node connectivity.
- `MucAugment`, `MucAttenuate`, `MucUpdate`: Handle path and dependency augmentations and attenuations.
- `UpdateSigmas`: Manage the sigma values contributing to betweenness centrality calculations.

### Structures:
- `SubGraph`: Encapsulates the logic for handling a graph's substructure. Provides implementations for various traits to manage node interactions and path-based metrics.
- `SubGraphDebugger`: Provides debugging functionality to inspect the state of a `SubGraph`, optionally including node information.

### Example Usage
To utilize this crate, instantiate a `SubGraph` and perform operations that fit your application's needs, such as updating sigmas or managing path dependencies. Utilize exported macros for delegating functionality where necessary:

```rust
// Example of creating a new SubGraph
let mut subgraph = SubGraph::empty("example_subgraph");
subgraph.insert_edge_between_nodes(src_node_id, dst_node_id).unwrap();
subgraph.muc_compute_new_path_counts_and_paths(src_node_id, dst_node_id);
```

## Building and Integration
Compile the crate in a `no_std` environment for embedded applications if necessary, or integrate it with a broader system as part of a dependency in your project's `Cargo.toml`.

## Notes
- The crate is under active development, and interfaces may expand or change over time.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.
