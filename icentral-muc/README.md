# icentral-muc

## Overview

`icentral-muc` is a Rust crate offering an efficient interface for interacting with **Minimum Union Cycles** (MUCs) in graph data structures. These cycles are crucial in analyzing betweenness centrality and connectivity within complex networks.

This crate provides an extensive suite of traits and structures designed to facilitate the discovery, management, and manipulation of MUCs. By utilizing advanced graph theory concepts, `icentral-muc` empowers developers to handle key data extraction and analysis tasks specific to MUCs with precision and efficiency.

## Features

- **GraphHashMucInterface**: A foundational trait ensuring that any graph structure conforms to the requisite interface for MUC operations.

- **MUC Operations**: Extensive support for conducting MUC operations such as creation, merging, and clearing of cycles. This includes optimizing the discovery of betweenness centrality markers and subgraph extractions.

- **Concurrency and Lock Management**: Built-in use of concurrent data structures like `Arc` and `Mutex` for thread-safe manipulation of graphs.

- **Debugging and Testing**: Implementations of the `Debug` trait allow easy inspection of the internal states of Minimum Union Cycles to aid debugging and validation during development.

## Usage

To employ `icentral-muc` in your project, include it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-muc = "0.1.0"
```

Implement one or more traits provided by the crate on your graph data structures to render them compatible with MUC functions.

## Example

Here is an example demonstrating how to integrate this crate into a graph data type:

```rust
use icentral_muc::{FindMucs, GraphHashMucInterface};

struct MyGraph;

impl GraphHashMucInterface for MyGraph { }

impl FindMucs for MyGraph {
    fn find_mucs_fast(&mut self) -> Result<(), BetweennessCentralityError> {
        // Your implementation here
        Ok(())
    }

    fn find_mucs(&mut self) {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```

## Conceptual Background

Minimum Union Cycles (MUCs) are crucial for detecting central structural pathways within large-scale network models. They provide a framework to evaluate how single-node contributions affect overall network stability and flow. In computational terms, they assist in performing complex network analyses, including shortest path recalculations and structural integrity assessments in network dynamics studies.

## Conclusion

`icentral-muc` provides an expansive interface facilitating intricate graph manipulations to derive actionable insights from complex network data. For developers seeking to advance their understanding of network centralities and cycle detection, this crate serves as an essential toolkit.
