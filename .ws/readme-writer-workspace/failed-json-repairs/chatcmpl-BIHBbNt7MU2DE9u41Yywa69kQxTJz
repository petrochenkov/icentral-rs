    "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Naive\n\nThe `icentral-naive` crate provides an implementation of the Naive Betweenness Centrality algorithm for graph analysis. Betweenness Centrality is a key metric in network theory and is used to infer the importance of nodes within a graph. This crate relies on the straightforward algorithmic approach to calculate the betweenness centrality scores of nodes, focusing on easy integration and usability.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Naive Algorithm Implementation**: A direct implementation of the classical betweenness centrality computation through an exhaustive search method.\n- **Concurrent Graph Handling**: Utilizes Rust's `Arc` and `Mutex` to allow safe concurrent access and manipulation of graphs.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo compute the betweenness centrality:\n\n```rust\nuse std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};\nuse icentral_naive::{Graph, naive_betweenness_centrality};\n\n// Assume graph is an initialized Arc<Mutex<Graph<GraphHash>>> instance.\nlet graph = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Graph::new()));\n\nmatch naive_betweenness_centrality(graph) {\n    Ok(scores) => println!(\"Betweenness scores: {:?}", scores),\n    Err(e) => eprintln!(\"Error computing centrality: {:?}", e),\n}\n```\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe crate defines the `NaiveBetweennessCentrality` struct which keeps track of necessary internal structures including `BetweennessScores`, `AllPairsDistances`, and `AllPairsShortestPathCounts`. It predominantly operates under the hood to facilitate the computation of scores through graph distance evaluation and shortest path counting.\n\nNote: This crate uses Rust's 2021 edition, benefiting from its latest features and improvements.\n\n## Limitations & Performance\n\nBeing a naive implementation, it may exhibit performance constraints on very large graphs as it utilizes an exhaustive approach to evaluate centrality for all node pairs.\n\n---\n\n*This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, yet aims to provide comprehensive guidance.*",
