  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-subgraph\n\n`icentral-subgraph` is a Rust library designed to facilitate efficient management and computation of subgraphs within a broader graph context, with a primary focus on betweenness centrality metrics. It leverages specific algorithmic structures to compute shortest paths, manage node connectivity, update dependency metrics, and more, through a rich set of traits and methods defined within the `SubGraph` structure.\n\n## Features\n- **SubGraph Representation:** Manage and manipulate graph subsets using `SubGraph` and associated utilities.\n- **Betweenness Centrality:** Efficiently calculate betweenness centrality metrics for nodes using specialized algorithms.\n- **Path Management:** Handle path calculations, including updating pair dependencies and sigma values.\n- **BFS Algorithms:** Implement BFS techniques for graph traversal and marking nodes.\n- **Edge Management:** Insert and remove edges, ensuring dynamic updates to the graph structure.\n\n## Concepts and Usage\n\n### Core Traits:\n- `MucComputeNewPathCountsAndPaths`: Define operations for computing new path counts based on node connectivity.\n- `MucAugment`, `MucAttenuate`, `MucUpdate`: Handle path and dependency augmentations and attenuations.\n- `UpdateSigmas`: Manage the sigma values contributing to betweenness centrality calculations.\n\n### Structures:\n- `SubGraph`: Encapsulates the logic for handling a graph's substructure. Provides implementations for various traits to manage node interactions and path-based metrics.\n- `SubGraphDebugger`: Provides debugging functionality to inspect the state of a `SubGraph`, optionally including node information.\n\n### Example Usage\nTo utilize this crate, instantiate a `SubGraph` and perform operations that fit your application's needs, such as updating sigmas or managing path dependencies. Utilize exported macros for delegating functionality where necessary:\n\n```rust\n// Example of creating a new SubGraph\nlet mut subgraph = SubGraph::empty(\"example_subgraph\");\nsubgraph.insert_edge_between_nodes(src_node_id, dst_node_id).unwrap();\nsubgraph.muc_compute_new_path_counts_and_paths(src_node_id, dst_node_id);\n```\n\n## Building and Integration\nCompile the crate in a `no_std` environment for embedded applications if necessary, or integrate it with a broader system as part of a dependency in your project's `Cargo.toml`.\n\n## Notes\n- The crate is under active development, and interfaces may expand or change over time.\n\n---\n\n_Note: This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate.
