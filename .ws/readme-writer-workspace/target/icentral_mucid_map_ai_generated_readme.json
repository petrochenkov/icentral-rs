  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-mucid-map\n\nThe `icentral-mucid-map` crate is designed to provide efficient and reliable mappings between `NodeId` and `MucId`, encapsulated within the `MucIdMap` struct. This crate is implemented with cutting-edge Rust programming features, aspiring to deliver high-performance capabilities for complex applications.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Trait Implementation:** Implements the `GetNodesToMucs` trait, which provides access to the `MucIdMap`.\n- **MucIdMap Structure:** A robust data structure that maps `NodeId` to `MucId`, supporting various operations such as iteration, initialization, and reinitialization.\n- **Extensible Design:** With traits like `CreateEmptyIndexed`, `CreateEmptyMapped`, `ReinitWithLen`, and `FillWith`, the `MucIdMap` is adaptable for different application requirements.\n\n## Usage Example\n\nTo integrate `icentral-mucid-map` into your project, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-mucid-map = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_mucid_map::{MucIdMap, GetNodesToMucs};\n\nlet mut muc_id_map = MucIdMap::empty_indexed(\"example_map\");\nmuc_id_map.set_mucid_for_node(node_id, muc_id);\nlet muc_id = muc_id_map.mucid_for_node(node_id);\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n- **`GetNodesToMucs` Trait:** Ensures access to the internal mappings.\n- **`MucIdMap` Struct:** A comprehensive structure with various operations for managing mappings between node IDs and their corresponding minimum union cycle IDs.\n\n## Debugging\n\nThis crate employs rigorous debugging (${RUST_LOG_CONTROL}). Detailed logs are generated using `debug!()` for introspecting the operations and transformations during execution. Fine-grained debugging support is available throughout, facilitating easy troubleshooting and performance optimization.\n\n---\n\n*This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, though it aims to be comprehensive and precise.*",
