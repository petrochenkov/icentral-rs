  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Conn Vertex Map\n\nThe `icentral-conn-vertex-map` crate offers a sophisticated data structure designed for efficient representation and manipulation of connectivity mappings between nodes in a computational graph. Designed for high-performance applications, it allows developers to manage connectivity using a `ConnVertexMap` which stores and retrieves node-to-node connection information with optimal efficiency.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Efficient Connectivity Management**: Quickly manage connections between nodes with robust methods such as `vertices_for_node`, `set_vertex_map_for_node`, and `clear`.\n- **Mutable and Immutable Access**: Seamlessly switch between mutable and immutable data access through methods that either safely reference or mutate node connections.\n- **Iterative Access**: Utilize `iter` for traversing connectivity mappings, facilitating streamlined operations over node connections.\n- **Flexibility with Indexed and Mapped Modes**: Employ `empty_indexed` or `empty_mapped` constructors to initialize the map in states optimized for specific connectivity scenarios.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Storage Structure\nAt the heart of the `ConnVertexMap` is a `MaybeIndexedMap`, which offers an advanced mapping solution capable of efficient storage and retrieval operations, catering to complex node connectivity patterns.\n\n### API Overview\n\n- **vertices_for_node**: Retrieve a list of connected node IDs for a specific node. \n- **vertices_for_node_mut**: Obtain a mutable reference to node connections, enabling dynamic updates.\n- **set_vertex_map_for_node**: Define or redefine the connections for a node, allowing reintegration into the network topology.\n- **has_mapping_for_node**: Check existence of a node mapping, aiding in data validation and integrity checks.\n- **clear**: Reset the entire connectivity map, invaluable in scenarios requiring quick reinitialization.\n\n## Usage\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_conn_vertex_map::ConnVertexMap;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut conn_map = ConnVertexMap::empty_indexed(\"My Graph\");\n    let node_id = 42;\n    let connected_nodes = vec![1, 2, 3];\n\n    conn_map.set_vertex_map_for_node(node_id, connected_nodes);\n\n    if conn_map.has_mapping_for_node(node_id) {\n        println!(\"Node {} is connected to: {:?}\", node_id, conn_map.vertices_for_node(node_id));\n    }\n\n    conn_map.clear();\n    assert!(!conn_map.has_mapping_for_node(node_id));\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `icentral-conn-vertex-map` is an essential tool for developers working with graph data structures requiring mutable connectivity mappings. Its methods support robust, efficient, and flexible data operations that are crucial for addressing real-world computational problems in networked environments.\n\n---\n\n*This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate.
