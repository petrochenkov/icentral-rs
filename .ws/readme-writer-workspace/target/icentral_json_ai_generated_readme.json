  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-json\n\n## Overview\n\n`icentral-json` is a Rust crate that provides a robust mechanism for constructing JSON hierarchies using labeled two-level member configurations. It utilizes macros for ease of use and implements serialization for transforming complex data structures into JSON strings seamlessly. This crate serves as a utility for developers seeking to manipulate nested data arrangements and transform them efficiently into JSON format, leveraging the powerful capabilities of the Rust macro system.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Macros**: Provides macros such as `allow_twolevel_named_members` and `allow_twolevel_named_member` for creating named JSON structures exhibiting two-level nested hierarchies.\n- **Serialization**: Implements serialization via the `serde` crate, allowing for easy conversion of structs into JSON strings with the method `to_json()`.\n- **Struct Definition**: Features a core struct `BetweennessJsonBuilder` which encapsulates the address patterns between parent and child nodes, which can be instantiated and processed into JSON.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this crate, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-json = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_json::{BetweennessJsonBuilder, allow_twolevel_named_members};\nuse betweenness_json_builder::{ParentAddress, ChildAddress};\n\n// Assuming 'ParentAddress' and 'ChildAddress' are properly defined and deriving Serialize\nlet parent_address = ParentAddress::new(\"parent_address_example\");\nlet child_address = ChildAddress::new(\"child_address_example\");\n\nlet json_builder = BetweennessJsonBuilder::new(parent_address, child_address);\nlet json_representation = json_builder.to_json();\nprintln!(\"{}\", json_representation);\n```\n\n## License\n\n`icentral-json` is distributed under the MIT License.
