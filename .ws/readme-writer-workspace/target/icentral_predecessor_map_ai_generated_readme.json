  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Predecessor Map\n\n`icentral-predecessor-map` is a Rust crate designed for graph data processing, offering an optimized implementation of a predecessor map.\n\n## Overview\n\nA `PredecessorMap` is an essential component in graph algorithms, commonly used for tracking the traversal paths within a graph structure. This particular implementation uses a `MaybeIndexedMap` to hold node relationships efficiently, supporting dynamic graph operations while ensuring a streamlined association between nodes and their predecessors.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- Create indexed or mapped predecessor maps, facilitating flexible data handling.\n- Determine node relationships, such as predecessors and root status within a tree.\n- Efficiently reinitialize map structures to adapt to changing graph sizes or structures.\n- Useful in implementing graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's, Prim's, and BFS/DFS.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Creating a New Map\n\nTo create a new `PredecessorMap` instance, specify the nodes and a descriptive name:\n\n```rust\nlet nodes = vec![NodeId::new(1), NodeId::new(2)];\nlet predecessor_map = PredecessorMap::new_from_nodes(nodes, \"GraphPredecessorMap\");\n```\n\n### Modifying Map Data\n\nYou can set a predecessor for a specific node or check if a node is a tree root using:\n\n```rust\npredecessor_map.set_predecessor_for_node(NodeId::new(1), NodeId::new(2));\nlet is_root = predecessor_map.is_tree_root(NodeId::new(1));\n```\n\n### Operations\n\n- `empty_indexed` and `empty_mapped` are constructors to create maps without predefined node relations.\n- `reinit` allows you to reset the map with new capacities.\n\n## Why Use iCentral Predecessor Map?\n\nThis crate offers well-optimized operations essential for large-scale applications, providing requisite utilities in network analysis, dependency resolution, and beyond.\n\n## Note\n\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good.\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under MIT License.",
