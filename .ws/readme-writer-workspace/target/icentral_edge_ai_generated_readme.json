  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-edge\n\nThe `icentral-edge` crate provides a robust abstraction for handling graph edges within computational systems. Leveraging the flexibility afforded by Rust's type system, it efficiently models the bidirectional connectivity between nodes in a graph.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Edge Representation**: Each `Edge` struct captures a connection between two nodes, facilitating operations such as traversal and graph analysis.\n- **Debugging and Display**: Implements `fmt::Debug` and `fmt::Display` for an intuitive representation of edges.\n- **Utility Methods**: Create edges with specific nodes or random ones, check connectivity, and generate reversed edges using provided methods.\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-edge = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n### Example:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_edge::Edge;\n\nfn main() {\n    let edge = Edge::new_with_ids(1, 2);\n    println!(\"{}\", edge);  // Output: (1 <-> 2)\n\n    if edge.connects_nodes(1, 2) {\n        println!(\"Nodes are connected by edge.\");\n    }\n\n    let reversed_edge = edge.reversed();\n    println!(\"Reversed: {}\", reversed_edge);  // Output: (2 <-> 1)\n}\n```\n\n## Concepts\n\nThis crate extensively uses Rust's derivable traits to ensure edges are ordered, comparable, and hashable, aiding both the storage and retrieval processes in large-scale graph models.\n\n## Versions\n\nThis documentation is generated for version `0.1.0`.\n\n---\n\n*This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate.
