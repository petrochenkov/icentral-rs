  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral BBFS\n\n`icentral-bbfs` is a Rust library providing functionality for computing betweenness centrality in large network graphs through a specialized Breadth-First Search variant, namely Bidirectional BFS (BBFS). This crate is designed for advanced network analysis and suits academic researchers and performance-critical computational environments where efficient graph computations are imperative.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThe core functionality revolves around calculating the shortest paths and betweenness centrality metric via bidirectional BFS, optimizing traversal from both source and destination nodes. It leverages `BBFSConfig` to allow finer control over computation, with options to handle new sigmas for path count precision.\n\n## Key Structures\n\n### `BBFSConfig`\n\nA structure that defines the configuration for the BBFS algorithm:\n- `edge`: An `Option<Edge>` representing the bidirectional edge, assuming `src` is nearer the source than `dst`.\n- `handle_new_sigmas`: A boolean to toggle computation of new and old sigma values, disabling the need for partial BFS computations later.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_bbfs::{BBFSConfig, bbfs};\n\nlet config = BBFSConfig::new_rbfs_d1(some_edge);\nbbfs(Some(config), &mut workspace, &component, source_node_id)?;\n```\n\n## Advanced Considerations\n\n- Assumes `edge.src` is closer to the BFS source.\n- Toggle `handle_new_sigmas` for more comprehensive sigma computations.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd to your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-bbfs = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Licensing\n\nThis software is distributed under the MIT License.\n\n---\n\n*Note: This README.md was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate however it should be pretty good.*",
