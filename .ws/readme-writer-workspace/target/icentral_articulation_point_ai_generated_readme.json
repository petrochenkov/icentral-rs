  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-articulation-point\n\n`icentral-articulation-point` is a sophisticated Rust crate that provides an efficient implementation for identifying articulation points within a graph. Articulation points, also known as cut vertices, are crucial in understanding the vulnerability of networked systems as their removal increases the number of connected components in a graph.\n\n## Features\n- **Efficient Articulation Point Detection**: Leverages depth-first search strategies for determining articulation points.\n- **Robust Context Management**: Utilizes an internal context to manage traversal state, predicated on `ColorMap`, `DistanceMap`, and `PredecessorMap` for stateful execution.\n- **Practical Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error management utilizing `BetweennessCentralityError` for resilience in complex computations.\n\n## Traits and Methods\n\n### `FindArticulationPoints`\nThis trait defines the core methods for articulation point detection:\n- `fn find_articulation_points(&self, out_vec: &mut Vec<NodeId>)`: Initiates the discovery of articulation points and stores them in the provided vector.\n- `fn articulation_point_dfs_visitor(...)`: A recursive helper performing depth-first search to locate articulation points.\n- `fn articulation_point_dfs_visitor_step_tree_edge(...)`: Manages tree-edge transitions during DFS traversal.\n\n### Structures\n- `ArticulationPointFinderContext<'a>`: Manages traversal metadata and state, indispensable for articulation point computation.\n\n## Usage\nAdd this crate to your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-articulation-point = \"0.1.0\"\n```\nImplement `FindArticulationPoints` for your graph type, ensuring that it accommodates graph-related traits such as `NumNodes` and `GetNeighborsForNode`.\n\n## Licenses\nThis crate is distributed under the terms of the MIT license.\n\n---\n\n*This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, although it should provide a solid foundation.*",
