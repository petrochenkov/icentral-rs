  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Path Counts\n\nThe `icentral-path-counts` crate offers a dynamic and robust system for managing and computing path counts associated with nodes in a graph-like data structure. This crate is particularly useful for high-performance scenarios where efficient manipulation and retrieval of path count data is critical.\n\n## Overview\n\nAt its core, this crate provides the `PathCountForNode` trait and the `PathCounts` struct. These components encapsulate functionality to maintain path count information for nodes effectively, making it a strategic choice for path analysis tasks in graph algorithms or network flow computations.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **PathCountForNode Trait**: Defines the essential operations to access and modify path count data for nodes.\n- **PathCounts Struct**: Implements the `PathCountForNode` trait and offers additional methods to increment, set, and compute path counts. It supports initialization variants, such as `empty_indexed`, `empty_mapped`, and with custom lengths.\n\n### Features\n\n- **Incremental Path Updates**: Provides methods for incrementing path counts directly or from another node.\n- **Precision Control**: Supports direct manipulation of path count values, including setting them to specific counts or zeroing them.\n- **Ratio Computation**: Offers functionality to compute the ratio of path counts between nodes, facilitating comparative analysis.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo incorporate this crate in your project, add it to `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-path-counts = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\nFor usage, import the crate and utilize the `PathCounts` struct to manage your node path counts:\n\n```rust\nuse izopath_counts::{PathCounts, PathCountForNode};\n\nlet mut path_counts = PathCounts::new(5, \"example_counts\");\npath_counts.increment_path_count_for_node(0, 1);\nlet count = path_counts.path_count_for_node(0);\n```\n\nAdvanced users can leverage macros provided by the crate for more complex configurations. \n\n### Note\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, but it should be pretty good.",
