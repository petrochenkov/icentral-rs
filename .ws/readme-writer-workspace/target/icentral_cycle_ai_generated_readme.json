  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-cycle\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `icentral-cycle` crate provides functionalities for representing and manipulating cycles within a graph. It specializes in calculating the Minimum Cycle Basis (MCB) for a given graph, an essential task in graph theory that aids in various applications such as network design, chemistry, and optimization problems. The Minimum Cycle Basis of a graph is a compact representation of its cycle space, primarily significant for its efficiency in accounting for all the cycles within a graph.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Cycle Representation**: Each cycle is represented as a list of edges, enabling efficient cycle manipulation and evaluation.\n- **Minimum Cycle Basis**: Efficiently computes the Minimum Cycle Basis of the graph, providing a foundational analysis tool for further graph algorithms.\n- **Edge Indexing**: Access individual edges within a cycle using Rust's index operations, facilitating detailed cycle analysis and operations.\n- **Trait Implementations**: Includes implementations of the `NumEdges` trait to quickly access the number of edges and the `CreateEmpty` trait for initializing an empty set of cycles.\n\n## Usage\n\nInclude the crate in your `Cargo.toml` dependencies and leverage the interfaces to construct, explore, and analyze cycle bases for graphs.\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-cycle = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_cycle::{Cycle, MinimumCycleBasis};\n\nlet basis = MinimumCycleBasis::empty();\nlet num_cycles = basis.num_cycles();\nprintln!(\"Number of cycles in the basis: {}\", num_cycles);\n```\n\n## Safety and Performance\n\nThe `icentral-cycle` crate adheres to Rust's safety guarantees, ensuring memory safety and the elimination of common programming bugs such as null pointer dereferencing.\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions to the crate are welcome. Please adhere to the standard Rust community guidelines and format your code using Rust's `fmt` tool.\n\n---\n\n*This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should effectively guide you in utilizing the `icentral-cycle` crate.*",
