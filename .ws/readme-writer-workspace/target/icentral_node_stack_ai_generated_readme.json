  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-node-stack\n\n`icentral-node-stack` is a Rust crate that provides efficient, stack-based data management functionality with traits and implementations tailored for handling `NodeId` structures. It offers a robust interface to maintain and manipulate collections of node identifiers, facilitating operations essential for traversal, modification, and analysis in data structure management.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Node Access and Mutation**: Use `NodeAtIndex` and `SetNodeAtIndex` traits to access and modify nodes at specific indices.\n- **Stack Operations**: Built-in support for `push` and `pop`, streamlining operations typical of stack data structures through the `Push` and `Pop` traits.\n- **Debug and Clear Capabilities**: Implementations of `CreateNamedEmpty` and `Clear` further enhance the management of node stacks.\n- **Custom Macros**: The `delegate_to_bfs_stack!` macro provides extensive capabilities for integrating breadth-first search strategies directly within stack operations.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo utilize the `icentral-node-stack` crate, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-node-stack = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_node_stack::{NodeIdStack, NodeId, Push, Pop};\n\nfn main() {\n    let first_node = NodeId::new(); // Assume NodeId::new() creates a new NodeId\n    let mut stack = NodeIdStack::new(first_node, \"example\");\n    \n    // Push a new node\n    stack.push(NodeId::new());\n    \n    // Access a node at index\n    let node = stack.node_at_index(0);\n\n    // Modify a node at a specific index\n    stack.set_node_at_index(0, NodeId::new());\n\n    // Pop a node\n    if let Some(popped_node) = stack.pop() {\n        println!(\"Popped node: {:?}\", popped_node);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor further information and more intricate usage patterns, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.rs/icentral-node-stack). This documentation includes additional examples and feature explanations to assist you in effectively utilizing this crate.\n\n---\n\n*This README.md file was generated by an AI model.
