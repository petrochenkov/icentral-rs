  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Test Incremental QUBE\n\n`icentral-test-incremental-qube` is an advanced Rust crate designed for efficiently calculating betweenness centrality updates in dynamic graph structures. The primary focus is the implementation of algorithms facilitating the rapid updating of centrality scores upon incremental changes, such as edge insertions, exploiting the properties of Minimum Union Cycles (MUCs).\n\n### Features\n- **Incremental Centrality Computation**: Quickly update betweenness centrality scores leveraging MUCs without computing from scratch.\n- **Efficient Edge Handling**: Seamlessly integrates new edges using specialized graph data structures for skewed properties.\n- **Performance Analysis**: Built-in functions to monitor and log computational time, speedups, and other performance metrics compared to traditional Brandes algorithm.\n\n### Usage\nThis crate requires setting up a `Graph` type with specific trait implementations:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_test_incremental_qube::exp_inc_qube_p;\n\nlet mut graph = /* initialize graph here */;\nlet rand_edge_vec = /* vector of edges to insert */;\nlet brandes_time = /* timing from Brandes computation */;\n\nexp_inc_qube_p(&mut graph, None, &rand_edge_vec, brandes_time).expect(\"Failed to update betweenness centrality\");\n```\n\n### Mathematical Concepts\n- **Betweenness Centrality**: A measure of a vertex's significance in terms of the number of shortest paths passing through it in the graph.\n- **Minimum Union Cycles (MUCs)**: Graph substructures used here to optimize the edge insertion process leading to expedited centrality recalculations.\n\n### Technical Requirements\nThis crate requires the implementation of several traits for the `Graph` generics, such as `InsertEdgeUpdateMuc`, `NodeIdToMucId`, and others, facilitating the interaction with the graph's internal structure.\n\n### Safety and Warnings\nThe crate is designed with performance in mind. Ensure that graph operations do not lead to unintentional data races or memory issues, particularly under concurrent contexts.\n\n### Disclaimer\nThis README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% precise. However, it should serve as a comprehensive guide to the functionalities and usage of the crate.",
