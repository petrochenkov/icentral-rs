  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-test-speedup\n\n`icentral-test-speedup` is a Rust crate designed to provide optimized estimates of algorithmic speedup without the assumption that all edges originate from a single biconnected component. This focuses on analyzing and enhancing the efficiency of graph-based computations using edge insertion strategies.\n\n## Features\n- **Biconnected Component Analysis**: Utilizes advanced techniques in finding biconnected components essential for accurate speedup estimation.\n- **Random Edge Generation**: Injects randomness in edge selection to simulate various graph scenarios.\n- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed statistical outputs, including mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max speedup estimations, are calculated to inform potential optimizations.\n\n## Usage\nEnsure your graph structures implement the `BccGraphHashInterface` trait to utilize `speedup_info`. Refer to the example below:\n```rust\nuse icentral_test_speedup::speedup_info;\n// Assuming `MyGraph` is a graph instance implementing `BccGraphHashInterface`\nspeedup_info(&mut my_graph, num_edges_to_insert);\n```\n\n## Mathematical Basis\nThe crate employs the iterative calculation of pruning counts derived from specific subgraph conditions to estimate computational speedup. It uses graph node and edge counts to determine performance changes upon modifications.\n\n## Requirements\n- Rust edition 2021\n- Ensure the graph component interfaces correctly with the provided API functions.\n\n## Limitations\nSpeedup estimates are inherently statistical and should be used as guidelines rather than absolute metrics.\n\n\n---\n\n*This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, however, it should be pretty good.*\n",
