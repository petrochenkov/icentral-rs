  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Sigmas\n\n`icentral-sigmas` is a Rust library designed to efficiently manage and manipulate sigma values associated with graph nodes. It provides a robust infrastructure for setting, getting, updating, and computing ratios of sigma values, with a focus on performance and precision.\n\nThis crate is particularly useful in scenarios involving graph-based data structures where sigma calculations are necessary - such as simulations, optimizations, scientific computations, and other applications requiring node-centric analyses.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Trait-based Interfaces**: Define standardized functionality for setting and getting sigma values.\n  ```rust\n  pub trait GetSigmaValueForNode {\n      fn sigma_value_for_node(&self, node: NodeId) -> f64;\n  }\n\n  pub trait SetSigmaValueForNode {\n      fn set_sigma_value_for_node(&mut self, node: NodeId, val: f64);\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **SigmaMap Structure**: A comprehensive structure that implements these traits and provides a plethora of methods to manipulate sigma values.\n\n- **Macro Support**: Use the `delegate_to_sigmas!` macro for delegating functionalities to sigma value operations conveniently.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo include `icentral-sigmas` in your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies section:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-sigmas = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nCreate a new `SigmaMap` and manipulate sigma values:\n```rust\nlet mut sigma_map = SigmaMap::new(10, \"ExampleMap\");\nsigma_map.set_sigma_value_for_node(1, 2.5);\nprintln!(\"Sigma value for node 1: {}\", sigma_map.sigma_value_for_node(1));\n```\n\n### Updating Sigma Values\nUse the `update` method for complex updates based on the sigma values of two nodes and a multiplier:\n```rust\nsigma_map.update(2, 3, 1.2);\n```\n\n### Ratio Calculations\nCompute the ratio of sigma values between two nodes:\n```rust\nlet ratio = sigma_map.ratio(4, 5);\nprintln!(\"Sigma ratio: {}\", ratio);\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This README file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate.
