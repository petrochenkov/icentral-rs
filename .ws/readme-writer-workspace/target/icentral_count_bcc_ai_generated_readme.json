  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-count-bcc\n\n`icentral-count-bcc` is a robust and efficient Rust library designed to facilitate the analysis of graph structures, specifically focusing on the biconnected components (BCC) within a given graph. This crate provides functionality to count the number of biconnected components that meet or exceed a specific edge threshold, thereby aiding in detailed graph analysis and network connectivity studies.\n\n## Overview\n\nA biconnected component of a graph is a maximal biconnected subgraph. Such components are vital in graph theory and network reliability analysis as their removal can significantly disrupt the connectivity of the graph. The `icentral-count-bcc` crate helps identify how connected a graph structure is by determining its biconnected components.\n\n## Features\n\n- Identifies and counts biconnected components within a graph.\n- Computes components based on a specified minimum number of edges.\n- Offers utilities for detailed component size analysis and reporting.\n- Integrates logging for advanced debugging and analysis.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo leverage the utility provided by `icentral-count-bcc`, a user must implement or use types conforming to specific interfaces required by the main counting functionality.\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_count_bcc::count_bcc;\n\nlet mut graph = ...; // Initialize your graph structure here\nlet min_edges = 5;\nlet result = count_bcc(&mut graph, min_edges);\n\nmatch result {\n    Ok(_) => println!(\"Biconnected component count successful\"),\n    Err(e) => eprintln!(\"An error occurred: {:?}\", e),\n}\n```\n\nThe function `count_bcc` expects the graph to implement several traits, such as `PrintHeader`, `NumEdges`, and `FindBiconnectedComponent`, which are crucial for operating within this framework.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis crate is built upon the 2021 edition of Rust, ensuring compatibility with the latest features and language enhancements. \n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to `icentral-count-bcc` are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/example/icentral-count-bcc). \n\n---\n\n*This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should provide a strong foundation for users to understand and effectively use the crate.*",
