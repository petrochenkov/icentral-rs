  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-bc-mem\n\nicentral-bc-mem offers a robust mechanism for managing memory workspaces through its main structure `BcMemWorkspace`. This crate is oriented for advanced Rust developers who are paving intricate memory layout and manipulation strategies, particularly in scenarios that involve hierarchical node management.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Hierarchy Management:** Handle nested structures efficiently using a vector of vectors for node-level representation, facilitating node additions, deletions, and hierarchical operations.\n- **Map-Based Memory Organization:** Implement sophisticated memory handling with `ParentsMap` and `SigmaMap`, leveraging these constructs to organize memory in a configurable way.\n- **Interfaces and Functions:** \n  - Dynamically manage named empty workspaces with the `CreateNamedEmpty` implementation.\n  - Seamlessly resize memory allocations and access specific node-level information.\n\n## Usage\n\nIntegrate `BcMemWorkspace` within your application where memory mapping and node organization are paramount. Use the provided APIs to craft refined hierarchical and memory models.\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_bc_mem::BcMemWorkspace;\nlet mut workspace = BcMemWorkspace::empty(\"workspace1\");\nworkspace.push_level(vec![NodeId::new(1), NodeId::new(2)]);\n```\n\nicentral-bc-mem encourages developers to engage with memory layout mechanisms at a fundamental level, potentially benefiting compilers or simulation engines.\n\n## Integration\n\nTo integrate `icentral-bc-mem` into your project, update your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\ndependencies = {\n    icentral-bc-mem = \"0.1.0\"\n}\n```\n\n## Note\n\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model. While we strive for accuracy and clarity, please verify details to ensure they meet your specific needs.\n",
