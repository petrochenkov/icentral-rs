  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-scratch\n\n`icentral-scratch` is a Rust crate designed for developers working with graph-theoretic algorithms that focus on biconnected components and betweenness centrality within complex graph structures. It optimizes the computation of betweenness centrality for nodes by leveraging articulated structures within biconnected components to enhance performance.\n\nKey Features:\n- Provides an interface to effectively find, manage and debug biconnected components and articulation points within a graph using the `BiconnectedComponentsScratch` struct.\n- Includes robust methods `find_edge_bcc_with_scratch` and `find_edge_bcc_with_scratch_step` for efficient edge-based operations within graph networks.\n- Computes betweenness centrality for nodes using an iterative approach, supporting real-world graph sizes with potential articulation.\n\n## Usage\nTo utilize `icentral-scratch` in your project, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-scratch = \"0.1.0\"\n```\nRefer to the trait `FindEdgeBccWithScratch` and struct `BiconnectedComponentsScratch` for primary API functionalities.\n\n## Getting Started\nHere is a basic example of how to employ the crate:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_scratch::{FindEdgeBccWithScratch, BiconnectedComponentsScratch, BetweennessCentralityError};\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), BetweennessCentralityError> {\n    let mut bcc_scratch: BiconnectedComponentsScratch<YourGraphHandler> = BiconnectedComponentsScratch::empty(\"example_graph\");\n\n    // Example node initiation and edges integration\n    // ...\n\n    bcc_scratch.compute_bc(&mut scores, Option::None)?;\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nWe assume familiarity with Rust and graph theory to maximize the potential of `icentral-scratch`. The library operates seamlessly with any graph representation following the expected trait implementations.\n\n## Note\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should convey the substantial details for effective crate usage.\n",
