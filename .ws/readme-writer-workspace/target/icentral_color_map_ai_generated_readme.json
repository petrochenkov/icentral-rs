  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Color Map\n\nThe `icentral-color-map` crate provides an efficient mechanism for representing, manipulating, and accessing color mapping for nodes in computational graphs or similar structures. This library is designed for high-performance applications requiring dynamic manipulation of node attributes, specifically node coloration.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Color Enum:** Effortlessly manage node states utilizing the `Color` enum, which currently supports two distinct states: `None` and `Grey`. Additional states can be integrated to extend functionality.\n- **ColorMap Struct:** Constitutes a robust map structure containing node color data, underpinned by the `MaybeIndexedMap`. This struct offers numerous utilities for color manipulation and query.\n- **Custom Formatting:** Implements the `fmt::Display` trait for clear and human-readable node color output.\n- **Versatile Construction:** Provides multiple methods to instantiate color maps, including `empty_indexed`, `empty_mapped`, and initialization from existing nodes with `new_from_nodes`.\n- **Efficient Node Operations:** Includes convenience functions to efficiently set node colors, check if a node is colored, retrieve colors, and reinitialize maps.\n\n## Usage\nAssume you have a list of nodes for which you want to initialize a color map:\n```rust\nuse icentral_color_map::{ColorMap, Color};\n\n// Initialize with nodes\nlet nodes = vec![NodeId(1), NodeId(2), NodeId(3)];\nlet mut color_map = ColorMap::new_from_nodes(nodes, \"ExampleColorMap\");\n\n// Set node color\ncolor_map.set_color_for_node_grey(NodeId(1));\n\n// Check if node is colored\nif color_map.is_colored(NodeId(1)) {\n    println!(\"Node 1 is colored grey\");\n}\n```\nAdvanced implementations can push the boundaries further by extending the permitted states of the `Color` enum or integrating this crate with larger centralized graph-processing systems.\n\n## Requirements\n- Rust 2021 edition\n\n## Notes\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate. However, it should be informative and useful for understanding the main functionalities of the `icentral-color-map` crate.\n",
