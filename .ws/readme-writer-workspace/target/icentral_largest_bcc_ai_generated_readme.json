  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-largest-bcc\n\n`icentral-largest-bcc` is a Rust crate designed to efficiently compute and analyze the largest biconnected components within a graph structure, primarily focusing on centrality metrics in graph theory.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe primary feature of this crate is the identification and computation of statistical analysis on the largest biconnected components (BCCs) in a graph. The largest BCC is identified based on the number of nodes, providing metrics essential for applications in graph analytics and network topology assessments.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Efficient Identification**: Leveraging advanced graph hashing interfaces, this crate efficiently discovers biconnected components within complex graph structures.\n\n- **Statistical Analysis**: Computes fractions of nodes and edges relative to the entire graph, providing insights into the significance of the components.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo employ this crate, instantiate a `Graph` object that conforms to the `BccGraphHashInterface` trait, and utilize the `lbcc_stat` function to derive statistical insights about the largest BCC.\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_largest_bcc::{LargestBiconnectedComponents, lbcc_stat};\n\n// Suppose you have a mutable graph implementing `BccGraphHashInterface`\nlet mut graph = /* your graph instantiation */;\n\nif let Ok(_) = lbcc_stat(&mut graph) {\n    // Successfully assessed the largest BCC\n} else {\n    // Handle errors associated with betweenness centrality\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Concepts\n\nThis crate builds on principles from graph theory, specifically the study of biconnected components which are crucial for understanding redundancy and fail-safe properties in networks.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to expand the crate's functionality and efficiency optimizations are welcome. The crate operates under the Rust 2021 edition.\n\n**Note**: This README.md was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, though it should be quite helpful.",
