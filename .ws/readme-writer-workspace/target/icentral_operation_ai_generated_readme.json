  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-operation\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `icentral-operation` crate provides an enumerative representation of fundamental operations: `Insertion` and `Deletion`. Designed with simplicity and performance in mind, this library is ideal for any system that requires robust handling of these operations, such as database engines, text editors, or command-line interfaces.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Enums for Operations**: Clearly defined `Insertion` and `Deletion` operations using Rust enums.\n- **Trait Implementations**: Derived traits like `Copy`, `Clone`, `Default`, `Debug`, `PartialEq`, and `Eq` ensure seamless integration into applications requiring cloning and comparison of operations.\n- **Utility Methods**: Method implementations such as `is_deletion()` and `is_insertion()` offer quick checks on the operation types.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo employ `icentral-operation` in your project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-operation = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\nHere is a simple example to get started:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_operation::Operation;\n\nfn process_operation(op: Operation) {\n    if op.is_insertion() {\n        println!(\"Performing insertion operation\");\n    } else if op.is_deletion() {\n        println!(\"Performing deletion operation\");\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let insert_op = Operation::Insertion;\n    let delete_op = Operation::Deletion;\n\n    process_operation(insert_op);\n    process_operation(delete_op);\n}\n```\n\n## Safety and Performance\n\nThis crate benefits from Rust's ownership system, guaranteeing memory safety and preventing data races. Optimized for performance, `icentral-operation` leverages Rust's zero-cost abstractions to minimize runtime overhead.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please ensure your code adheres to the Rust community coding standards.\n\n\n---\n\n*This README was generated by an AI model.
