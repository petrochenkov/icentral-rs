  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral RBFS\n\n`icentral-rbfs` is a Rust crate designed for high-performance computation of betweenness centrality using Recursive Breit-First Search (RBFS) strategies. This crate provides efficient mechanisms for updating and recalculating betweenness centrality scores in dynamic or static graphs, utilizing biconnected components and graph types for optimized computation paths.\n\n## Overview\n\nBetweenness centrality is a fundamental metric in network analysis used to quantify the influence of a vertex within a graph. This crate focuses on providing tools to adjust and recompute this metric in the face of graph structure modifications such as vertex additions or removals.\n\n## Key Features\n- **RBFS Strategy**: Offers recursive breadth-first search algorithms tailored for dynamic graph updates.\n- **Biconnected Components Handling**: Efficient processing of graph components that are maximally biconnected, enhancing computation efficiency.\n- **Operation Modes**: Supports multiple operation modes through `RbfsOperation` enum, allowing addition and subtraction of vertex influences.\n\n## Usage\nTo leverage `icentral-rbfs` in your project, include it in your `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-rbfs = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n### Functions\n\n- **`rbfs`**: Executes a recursive breadth-first search, updating betweenness centrality scores.\n- **`rbfs_bcc`**: Specifically targets biconnected components to optimize recalculations of centrality.\n- **`rbfs_graph`**: Processes graph elements to adjust centrality scores based on graph structure changes.\n\nThese functions apply the RBFS principles to either a complete graph or segmented biconnected components, offering depth and precision in update scenarios.\n\n## Installation\nEnsure you are using Rust 2021 edition for compatibility. Further dependencies, if required, should align with this edition's features and libraries.\n\n## Contribution\nContributions are welcome. Please submit issues or pull requests to our repository if enhancements or bug fixes are needed.\n\n---\n\n_This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, however, it should be pretty good._",
