  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-deltas\n\n`icentral-deltas` is a Rust crate that provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for managing delta changes in data structures using a concept of delta mapping. This library is highly suitable for applications requiring dynamic and efficient updates to datasets, leveraging memory-efficient designs through the use of `MaybeIndexedMap`.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Delta Management**: Facilitates efficient tracking, updating, and resetting of deltas in a dataset using the core abstraction provided by `DeltaMap`.\n- **Custom Macros**: Includes `delegate_to_deltas`, a macro designed to streamline interactions with delta-based data, allowing for concise code structures.\n- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Supports operations like clearing the dataset, incrementally updating values, and computing ratios. These functionalities enable robust manipulation of datasets that evolve over time.\n\n## Core Structures\n\n### `DeltaMap`\nA pivotal construct in `icentral-deltas`, `DeltaMap` is equipped with several methods:\n- Creation functions like `empty_indexed`, `empty_mapped`, and `new` for initializing `DeltaMap` objects with different presets.\n- Update methods including `update`, `set_zero`, `set_one`, allowing precise control over delta states.\n- Utility functions such as `clear`, `len`, `get`, and `set` offer direct interactions with map contents.\n\n## Usage Example\nHere is a brief illustration of how `DeltaMap` can be utilized:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_deltas::DeltaMap;\n\n// Create a new `DeltaMap`\nlet mut delta_map = DeltaMap::new(10, \"example_map\");\n\ndelta_map.update(1, 2, 0.5);\nlet ratio = delta_map.ratio(1, 2);\nprintln!(\"Computed ratio: {}\", ratio);\n```\n\n## Installation\nAdd this crate to your dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-deltas = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.\n\n---\n\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, however, it should be pretty good.\n",
