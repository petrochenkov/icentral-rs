  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-mucid\n\n`icentral-mucid` is a Rust crate designed for managing identifiers associated with minimum union cycles within graph nodes, offering a straightforward API to access and manipulate these identifiers effectively. \n\n## Features\n\n- **MucIdForNode Trait**: Provides an interface to retrieve `MinimumUnionCycleId` for a given node using `mucid_for_node`.\n- **SetMucIdForNode Trait**: Enables setting a `MinimumUnionCycleId` for a node via `set_mucid_for_node`.\n- **Macro Expansion**: Utilize the `mucid!` macro for simplifying repetitive code tasks, enhancing expressiveness and maintaining robustness in your codebase.\n- **MinimumUnionCycleId Struct**: Efficient representation of a union cycle identifier, with utilities to manipulate and interact with node identifiers, including implementations for `Display`, and deriving traits such as `Clone`, `Copy`, `PartialEq`, and more.\n\n## Mathematical Foundation\n\nThis crate leverages fundamental concepts from discrete mathematics and graph theory, concentrating on minimal cycles, which are pivotal in algorithms that analyze or manipulate graph structures by aiming at optimal intersection points or paths.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo utilize the functionalities provided by `icentral-mucid`, import the relevant traits and structures into your Rust project's scope. \n\n```rust\nuse icentral_mucid::{MucIdForNode, SetMucIdForNode, MinimumUnionCycleId, mucid};\n\n// Example implementation\nstruct NodeIdExample;\nimpl MucIdForNode for NodeIdExample {\n    fn mucid_for_node(&self, node: NodeId) -> MinimumUnionCycleId {\n        // Implementation details here\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd `icentral-mucid` to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-mucid = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Contribution\n\nWe welcome contributions and improvements. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Please ensure your contributions are well-documented and tested.\n\n---\n\n*This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate however it should be pretty good.*\n",
