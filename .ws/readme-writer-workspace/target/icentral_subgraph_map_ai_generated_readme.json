Leveraging the power of the `MaybeIndexedMap` data structure and the Pareto-efficient use of computational resources, this crate allows users to dynamically associate and manipulate subgraphs with nodes in a graph structure.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe primary structure, `SubGraphMap`, provides an interface to manage subgraphs tied to specific graph nodes. Utilizing the capability of Rust's type system, this crate ensures safety and concurrency through the pervasive use of `Arc` to enable multiple ownership scenarios when associating a subgraph with a node.\n\n## Core Functionality\n- **set_subgraph_map_for_node:** Establishes a subgraph mapping for a given node.\n- **subgraph_for_node:** Retrieves the subgraph associated with a specific node.\n- **clear:** Removes all existing mappings, resetting the structure.\n- **has_mapping_for_node:** Checks if a node has an existing subgraph mapping.\n- **iter:** Provides an iterator over the subgraph mappings.\n- **empty_indexed / empty_mapped:** Constructs a new `SubGraphMap` with specified indexing versatility.\n\n## Example Usage\n```rust\nuse icentral_subgraph_map::SubGraphMap;\nuse std::sync::Arc;\n\nlet mut graph_map = SubGraphMap::empty_indexed(\"example_map\");\nlet subgraph_data = Arc::new(/* your subgraph data */);\ngraph_map.set_subgraph_map_for_node(node_id, subgraph_data.clone());\n\nif graph_map.has_mapping_for_node(node_id) {\n    let subgraph = graph_map.subgraph_for_node(node_id);\n    // utilize `subgraph`\n}\n\ngraph_map.clear();\n```\n\nThis guide offers an insight into how the `icentral-subgraph-map` crate operates, enabling developers to manage node-subgraph relationships effectively. Readers should have a cursorily understanding of Rust's concurrency models, if simultaneous operations on graph data are intended.\n\n---\n\n*This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate however it should be pretty good.*",
