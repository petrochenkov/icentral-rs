  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral-Mock\n\nThe `icentral-mock` crate provides mock structures to facilitate testing and prototyping of graph-related applications. This crate implements a basic enumeration, `GraphMock`, to represent various predefined graph structures that can be filled into custom graph implementations using traits like `ConnectNodeIds` and `InitWithSize`.\n\n## Use Cases\n`icentral-mock` is designed as a utility for developers looking to simulate graph topologies in Rust-based systems. It allows the construction and evaluation of graph algorithms, configuration of node connections, and initialization with arbitrary data structures.\n\n### Key Components\n\n- **GraphMock Enum:** This enum includes three primary variants - `PaperZero`, `Paper`, and `Basic`, each representing different mock graph structures with predefined node connections.\n\n- **Named Trait Implementation:** Each `GraphMock` variant is associated with a name, enhancing usability when integrating with complex systems.\n\n- **Graph Population Functionality:** Through the `fill` method, `GraphMock` instances can populate given graph data structures with sample topology, facilitating testing or demonstration of behavior under said connectivity.\n\n### Example Usage\n```rust\nuse icentral_mock::{GraphMock, ConnectNodeIds, InitWithSize};\n\nlet mut graph = YourGraphType::new();\nGraphMock::Paper.fill(&mut graph);\n// Now the graph is populated with the predefined topology of the Paper pattern.\n```\n\n## Technical Details\nThe crate emphasizes modularity and ease of integration with existing graph libraries by stipulating generic interfaces. Developers can use it to validate graph-theoretic constructs such as connectivity and pathfinding in controlled mock environments without actual data dependencies.\n\nThis README.md was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be sufficiently informative and relevant.",
