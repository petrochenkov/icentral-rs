  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-calculate-bc-mem\n\n## Overview\n\n`icentral-calculate-bc-mem` is an advanced Rust crate designed to perform efficient betweenness centrality computations in dynamic graph structures. Focused on memory optimization and incremental updates, this library facilitates the sophisticated manipulation of graph components to efficiently update the betweenness scores with minimal computational overhead.\n\n## Features\n\n- Perform incremental betweenness centrality calculation for subgraphs, efficiently updating the scores as edges are added or modified.\n- Memory-efficient operations with structures for `BcMemWorkspace` facilitating optimal resource usage.\n- Parallel processing support through synchronization mechanisms like `Arc` and `Mutex`.\n- Graph structures and algorithms are designed for high-performance computations, suitable for large-scale graphs.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_calculate_bc_mem::{update_bc_mem, construct_queue_for_bc_increment_computation};\nuse std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};\n\n// Assuming `graph` is a pre-defined graph structure\n// `bc_mem` and `scores` are betweenness centrality memory and score structures\n// `edge` represents the edge being assessed\n\nif let Err(e) = update_bc_mem(&mut bc_mem, &mut scores, &graph, edge, &mut workspaces) {\n    eprintln!(\"Error updating BC memory: {:?}\", e);\n}\n```\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Graph Handling**: Employs `Graph<GH>` with generic constraints supporting mapped nodes and node ID range management.\n- **Concurrency**: Utilizes safe concurrency patterns with Rust's ownership and lifetime guarantees.\n- **Memory Management**: Designed to efficiently handle memory reallocations and workspace management, ensuring optimized betweenness centrality calculations.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-calculate-bc-mem = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions via pull requests are welcome. Please ensure your changes are well-documented and tested.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n\n*Note: This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate.
