  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-timer\n\n`icentral-timer` is a highly efficient Rust-based crate designed to accurately measure the time interval between two events. It leverages the system's high-resolution clock to provide precise timing capabilities, making it ideal for performance-sensitive applications in various domains.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe core component is the `Timer` struct, encapsulating timing logic with an elegant, minimalistic interface. Utilizing Rust's `RefCell` and `Instant`, the `Timer` ensures both mutability and thread safety, allowing for versatility in concurrent applications.\n\n### Timer Struct\n\n- **start:** Implements the high-resolution starting point for measurement.\n- **stop:** Records the precise moment of stopping, permitting multiple readings.\n\n### Usage\n\n- **start():** Initiates timing, marked by the current instant.\n- **stop():** Concludes timing, determining the interval.\n- **interval():** Computes the duration between start and stop, returning a `Duration` object.\n\n### Example\n```rust\nuse icentral_timer::Timer;\n\nlet mut timer = Timer::default();\ntimer.start();\n// Perform some operations here\nlet duration = timer.interval();\nprintln!(\"Elapsed time: {:?}\", duration);\n```\n\n## Installation\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-timer = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Why Use icentral-timer?\n- **Precision:** Optimized for high-resolution timing.\n- **Simplicity:** Intuitive API minimizes boilerplate code.\n- **Concurrency Safety:** Suited for multi-threaded environments.\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n---\n\n_This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good._",
