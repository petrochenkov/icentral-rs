  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-test-insertion\n\n`icentral-test-insertion` is a Rust crate designed for efficiently testing and benchmarking edge insertion operations within a graph structure for centrality calculations. The primary focus of this crate is to evaluate the speedup and performance improvements when inserting edges in a graph using novel computational techniques.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis crate provides two core functions:\n\n1. **`insertion_test_fuad_hash`:**\n   - Purpose: Inserts a specified number of edges into a graph and calculates betweenness centrality, optimizing the Brandes algorithm with hash-based techniques.\n   - Returns: Measures such as average speedup and performance statistics.\n\n2. **`insertion_test_fuad_max_iter`:**\n   - Purpose: Similar to `insertion_test_fuad_hash`, but allows for iterative executions and detailed speedup analysis across multiple iterations.\n   - Returns: Detailed statistics on speedup factors, ideal conditions, and leverages biconnected components for further optimization.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Graph Centrality Optimization:** Utilize advanced hash functions to speed up the calculation of betweenness centrality.\n- **Custom Edge Insertion Strategies:** Implement custom edge insertion that iteratively tests performance improvements.\n- **Performance Tracking:** Thorough instrumentation for runtime analysis, including idealized speedup predictions.\n\n## How to Use\n\nImplement the graph structure you wish to analyze. Call `insertion_test_fuad_hash` or `insertion_test_fuad_max_iter` with your graph, specifying parameters such as edges to insert:\n\n```rust\nlet mut graph = Graph::<GraphHash>::new();\nlet num_edges = 10;\nmatch insertion_test_fuad_hash(&mut graph, num_edges) {\n    Ok(_) => println!(\"Insertion test completed successfully.\"),\n    Err(e) => eprintln!(\"Error encountered: {:?}\", e),\n}\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis crate depends on the `rand` crate for randomized edge insertion when generating new graph edges.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is MIT licensed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, though it should be quite informative and accurate enough for practical use cases.",
