  "full_readme_markdown": "# Icentral Label Map\n\n`icentral-label-map` is a versatile crate designed for handling label mappings within directed graphs. Employing advanced data structures, such as `HashMap`, this crate is optimized for efficiency when managing complex node relationships in graph theory applications. By leveraging the `LabelMap` structure, developers can create, modify, and query label maps dynamically, enabling seamless graph transformations and data manipulation.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `LabelMap` structure is implemented with various methods allowing for the creation of named empty maps, insertion and retrieval of node mappings, and edge remapping. Detailed macro definitions ensure repetitive operations are minimized, promoting concise code within your applications.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Dynamic Mapping**: Handle real-time updates to node mappings using `insert_outin` and `resize_inout`.\n- **Graph Transformations**: Effortlessly transform source and destination node pairs using `mapped_edge` and `projected_edge`.\n- **Flexible Initialization**: Generate label maps directly from graphs or specify initial sizes and default values.\n\n### Code Example\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_label_map::LabelMap;\n\nlet mut map = LabelMap::empty(\"MyMap\");\nmap.insert_outin(NodeId::new(1), NodeId::new(2));\nlet edge = map.mapped_edge(&Edge::new(NodeId::new(1), NodeId::new(2)));\n```\n\n## Installation\nAdd the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-label-map = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n### Note\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good.
