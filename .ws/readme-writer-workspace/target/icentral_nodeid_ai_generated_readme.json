  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-nodeid\n\n**icentral-nodeid** is a Rust crate designed for precise and efficient management of node identifiers within a given range. This library provides robust interfaces for interacting with node ID ranges, mapping, and iteration, essential for distributed systems where node management is critical. It is tailored for advanced Rust developers who understand system architecture and node-based systems, such as distributed databases, cluster management, or complex event processing networks.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis crate offers a suite of interfaces:\n\n- **GetNodeIdRange**: Obtain a vector representation of all node IDs within a specified range.\n- **GetLimitedNodeIdRange**: Fetch node IDs with an optional cap on their number to facilitate optimized iteration.\n- **HasMapForNode**: Determine if a map exists for a specified node for enhanced data management.\n- **MappedNodes**: Retrieve nodes that have been mapped for nodes' traversal or management.\n- **NumNodes**: Acquire the total number of nodes, supporting system analytics and monitoring.\n\n## Core Structs and Macros\n\n- **NodeIdRange**: Characterizes the start and length of a node ID range. Supports length retrieval and iteration.\n- **NodeId**: Models a single node identifier, implementable from `usize`. Provides utility methods such as `zero`, `bad`, and `val` for flexible node ID management.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere's a quick example of creating a new `NodeIdRange` and iterating over it:\n\n```rust\nlet range = NodeIdRange::new(0, 5);\nfor node in range {\n    println!(\"Node ID: {}\", node);\n}\n```\n\n## Advantageous Features\n\n- Easily generates and manipulates node ID ranges.\n- Offers customizable node range limitations.\n- Implements idiomatic Rust traits like `IntoIterator` for seamless integration into existing systems.\n\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good.\n",
