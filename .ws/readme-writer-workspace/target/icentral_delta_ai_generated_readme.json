This implementation enhances traditional approaches to betweenness centrality calculation by providing methods that specifically address the recalculation of centrality metrics when structural changes like edge insertions or deletions occur in dynamic networks.\n\n## Features\n\nThe core feature of this crate lies in its ability to accurately maintain and compute biconnected components. Utilizing a delta-based strategy, it minimizes computational overhead during graph updates, making it highly suitable for applications requiring real-time analytics on dynamic graphs.\n\nKey components include:\n- **BiconnectedComponentsDelta:** Manages biconnected components with accompanying subgraphs.\n- **Betweenness Centrality Computation:** Tools to efficiently recalculate betweenness centrality metrics when graph topology changes.\n- **Integration with GraphHash (GH):** Provides an adaptable framework to leverage external graph structures.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo integrate the `icentral-delta` crate into your Rust project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-delta = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n### Example\n\nBelow is a basic example demonstrating how to instantiate a `BiconnectedComponentsDelta` and perform a delta-based update:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_delta::{BiconnectedComponentsDelta, FindEdgeBccWithDelta};\n\n// Assume `Graph` implements the required traits.\nlet mut biconnected_components = BiconnectedComponentsDelta::<Graph>::empty(\"example_graph\");\n\nlet node_id: NodeId = ...; // Node ID of interest.\nlet edge: Edge = ...; // Edge to be evaluated.\n\n// Compute biconnected components with delta.\nbiconnected_components.find_edge_bcc_with_delta(&mut bcc, &edge).unwrap();\n```\n\nIt assumes familiarity with graph theories, such as nodes, edges, and biconnected components, and requires implementing traits for custom graph types.\n\n## Contribution\n\nContributions are welcome! If you find a bug or want to add new features, please submit an issue or a pull request.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis README file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, although it is intended to be helpful.\n",
