  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Visit Markers\n\n`icentral-visit-markers` is a Rust crate designed for efficient manipulation and tracking of graph traversal states, especially useful in algorithms involving graph exploration, such as depth-first or breadth-first search. The crate provides a robust mechanism to maintain node visitation states, encapsulating them in a structured and flexible manner.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Visit Tracking:** Efficiently track whether specific nodes within a graph are visited, supporting both indexed and mapped structures for storage flexibility.\n- **Macro Support:** Utilizes macros to streamline the delegation of functionalities related to marker operations.\n- **Flexible Initialization:** Instantiate marker sets from given nodes, with customizable initial visited states.\n- **Comprehensive API:** Includes methods for marking nodes as visited/unvisited, iterating over unvisited nodes, and reinitializing marker sets.\n- **Debugging Outputs:** Debug level logs provide insights during development and computation, aiding in understanding and optimizing graph traversal processes.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo start using `icentral-visit-markers` in your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-visit-markers = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_visit_markers::VisitMarkers;\n\nlet nodes = vec![NodeId(1), NodeId(2), NodeId(3)];\nlet mut markers = VisitMarkers::new_from_nodes(nodes, \"example_markers\");\n\nmarkers.visit(NodeId(1));\n\nassert!(markers.visited(NodeId(1)));\nassert!(!markers.visited(NodeId(2)));\n\nlet unvisited_nodes = markers.iter_unvisited();\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n---\n\n*This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, however, it should be pretty good.*",
