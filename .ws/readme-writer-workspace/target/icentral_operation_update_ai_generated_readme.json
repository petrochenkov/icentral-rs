  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-operation-update\n\n`icentral-operation-update` is a Rust crate designed to efficiently update betweenness centrality (BC) scores in large graph structures. This crate is implemented with a focus on handling both connected and biconnected components of a graph efficiently. The primary feature of this library is its capacity to manage the centrality recalibration of nodes during edge insertions and deletions, minimizing computational overheads.\n\n## Functional Overview\n\nThis crate includes the core functionality to update BC scores, which are critical for understanding the importance of vertices in network analysis. It leverages parallel processing and specialized algorithms for recalibrating the edge betweenness centrality when the graph undergoes modifications. These operations are crucial for applications requiring real-time or dynamic graph topology adjustments, such as network analysis, optimization, and scientific computations.\n\n### Major Operations\n\n- **Betweenness Centrality Update:** Automatically updates BC scores based on graph mutations.\n- **Biconnected Component Management:** Handles edge applications specifically within biconnected components.\n- **Graph Operations:** Executes efficient graph operations considering graph and component-specific attributes.\n\n## Usage\n\nBelow are the main interfaces provided by the crate:\n\n```rust\npub fn update_bc_for_graph<GH>(scores: &mut BetweennessScores, graph: &Graph<GH>, comp_type: CompType, mut edge: Edge, num_threads: usize, op: Operation) -> Result<(), BetweennessCentralityError>;\n\npub fn execute_biconnected_component_update_operation<GH>(graph: &mut Graph<GH>, component: &mut Component, edge: &mut Edge, op: &Operation);\n\npub fn update_bc_for_biconnected_component<GH>(scores: &mut BetweennessScores, graph: &mut Graph<GH>, comp_type: CompType, mut edge: Edge, num_threads: usize, op: Operation) -> Result<(), BetweennessCentralityError>;\n\npub fn update_bc<GH>(scores: &mut BetweennessScores, graph: &mut Graph<GH>, comp_type: CompType, mut edge: Edge, num_threads: Option<usize>, op: Option<Operation>) -> Result<(), BetweennessCentralityError>;\n```\n\nThe functions leverage multithreading to optimize the performance, especially with large data sets, and handle component-specific nuances to ensure robustness.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\nWith algorithmic processing optimized for parallel execution, the crate can deal with complex, large-scale graphs while ensuring low latency during updates.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-operation-update = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## License\n\n`icentral-operation-update` is released under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, although it should be quite useful.\n",
