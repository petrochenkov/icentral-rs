This metric is pivotal in network analysis, particularly in relation to determining the influence or importance of particular nodes within a graph structure.\n\nBetweenness centrality is computed by assessing the frequency at which a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between other nodes in the graph. This crate streamlines the process, enabling scalable calculations suitable for large graphs and complex structures.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Speed and Efficiency**: Utilizes Brandes algorithm, optimized for performance.\n- **Comprehensive Graph Support**: Compatible with any graph structure satisfying the required traits such as `CreateScoresVector` and `NumNodes`.\n- **Customizable Workspace**: Leverages `ICentralWorkspace` to dynamically allocate resources during computation.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo calculate betweenness centrality with `icentral-fast-brandes`, ensure your graph type fulfills the necessary trait bounds including, but not limited to, `CreateScoresVector`, `Debug`, `NumNodes`, `MappedNodes`, `GetNodeIdRange`, `GetNeighborsForNode`, and `GetEdges`.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the core function:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_fast_brandes::fast_brandes_bc;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), BetweennessCentralityError> {\n    let graph = /* initialize your graph data structure here */;\n    let scores = fast_brandes_bc(&graph)?;\n    println!(\"Betweenness Centrality Scores: {:?}\", scores);\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Concepts\n\n### Brandes Algorithm\n\nThe Brandes algorithm efficiently computes the shortest paths and subsequently derives the betweenness centrality by an incremental summation of dependencies. Due to its heavy reliance on Dijkstra's or BFS depending upon the graph's nature (weighted or unweighted), it demonstrates significant advantages in computational efficiency over simpler methods.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo include `icentral-fast-brandes` in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-fast-brandes = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome. Please open issues and create pull requests as needed. Let's build a decisive tool for network analysis together.\n\n---\n\n*Note: This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate.
