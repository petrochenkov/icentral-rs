  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-bridge-edges\n\n## Overview\n\n`icentral-bridge-edges` is a Rust crate designed to identify and extract bridge edges from graph structures. It employs the algorithmic concept of biconnected components to efficiently determine these critical edges within a graph. This crate is particularly useful in network analysis and graph theory applications where connectivity and failure analysis are paramount.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Trait Implementation**: `FindBridgeEdges` trait provides a seamless interface for finding bridge edges, which are edges that, when removed, increase the number of connected components in a graph.\n- **Efficient Algorithm**: Utilizes the art and science of biconnected component (BCC) identification to isolate bridge edges, ensuring performance efficiency.\n- **Graph Theory Application**: Ideal for applications requiring robustness and connectivity analysis of network graphs.\n\n## Usage\n\nHere's a basic example of how to use the `icentral-bridge-edges` crate:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_bridge_edges::FindBridgeEdges;\n\n// Assuming `Graph` implements `FindBiconnectedComponent` \nlet mut graph = Graph::new();\nlet bridge_edges = graph.find_bridge_edges();\nprintln!(\"Bridge Edges: {:?}\", bridge_edges);\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates instantiating a graph and utilizing the `find_bridge_edges` method to extract bridge edges.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-bridge-edges = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis crate is distributed under the MIT License.\n\n*Please note: This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, though it should be quite helpful.*",
