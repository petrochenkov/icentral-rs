  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Test Fast Brandes\n\nThis Rust crate implements a highly optimized version of the Brandes algorithm for computing betweenness centrality in graphs. The algorithm is pivotal in network analysis, providing insights into the importance of vertices in a network. Utilizing advanced optimization techniques, this crate significantly reduces computation time, making it suitable for large-scale graphs.\n\n## Features\n- Efficient computation of betweenness centrality.\n- Designed for performance with large datasets.\n- Utilizes Rust's 2021 edition features for enhanced safety and concurrency.\n\n## Installation\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-test-fast-brandes = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Usage\nImport the crate and utilize the functions to compute centrality metrics for your graph data. Refer to the function documentation for precise usage instructions.\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_test_fast_brandes::compute_centrality;\n\n// Example usage\nlet centrality = compute_centrality(&my_graph);\nprintln!(\"Betweenness Centrality: {:?}\", centrality);\n```\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome. Please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss potential changes.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThis project draws on established research in graph theory to deliver efficient network analysis tools.\n\n---\n\n*This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good.*",
