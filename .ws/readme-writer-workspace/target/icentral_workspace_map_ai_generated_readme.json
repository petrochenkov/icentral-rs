  "full_readme_markdown": "# ICentral Workspace Map\n\n`icentral-workspace-map` is a Rust crate designed for efficient workspace management within graph systems. It utilizes a `MaybeIndexedMap` to map nodes in a graph to their corresponding workspaces, providing both indexed and non-indexed modes for flexible management.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Efficient Workspace Initialization**: Create empty indexed or mapped workspace collections with ease.\n- **Graph Length Management**: Pre-allocate resources for a given graph length, optimizing memory usage and performance.\n- **Workspace Manipulation**: Convenient methods for accessing, modifying, and setting workspaces for different graph nodes.\n- **Graph Traversal Algorithms**: Supports Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Reverse BFS (RBFS) operations which can be parallelized in future versions.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Creating a WorkspaceMap\n\nTo start using the `WorkspaceMap`, initialize it with a desired length and name:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_workspace_map::WorkspaceMap;\n\nlet workspace_map = WorkspaceMap::new(10, \"example_map\");\n```\n\n### Manipulating Workspaces\n\n- **Check for Workspace**: Determine the existence of a workspace for a node using `has_workspace`.\n- **Access Workspace**: Use `workspace_ref` and `workspace_mut` to obtain immutable and mutable references, respectively.\n- **Set Workspace**: Directly set a workspace with `set_workspace_for_node`.\n\n### Graph Traversal\n\nPerform BFS and RBFS graph traversal with methods that can be optimized for parallel execution:\n\n```rust\nworkspace_map.bbfs(None, &component);\nworkspace_map.bbfs_rbfs(&mut scores, None, &mut component);\n```\n\n## Note\n\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model.
