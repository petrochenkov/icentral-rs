  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral-Timing-Update\n\nThe `icentral-timing-update` crate provides advanced functionalities for computational graph analysis, with a particular focus on timing updates of betweenness centrality calculations in both static and dynamic graphs. Designed for high performance and scalability, it supports parallel processing using MPI and multithreading.\n\n## Features\n- **Dynamic Betweenness Centrality Updates**: Efficiently update betweenness centrality scores when graph edges are inserted or removed.\n- **Graph Partitioning**: Utilize biconnected components and other graph algorithms to optimize computation.\n- **Random Edge Generation**: Generate random graphs and edge vectors for robust testing.\n- **Timed Performance**: Includes detailed timing and speedup analysis with synchronization barriers for precision measurement.\n\n## Usage\n```rust\nuse icentral_timing_update::{TimingUpdateConfig, timing_update_bc};\n\n// Configuration for timing updates\nlet config = TimingUpdateConfig::default();\n\n// Perform timing update on a set of graphs\nlet result = timing_update_bc(\n    vec![\"graph1.g\", \"graph2.g\"],\n    10,  // Number of random edges\n    42,  // Random seed\n    5,   // Number of sources\n    Some(CompType::BiconnectedComponent),\n    Some(4),  // Number of threads\n    Some(Operation::Insertion)\n);\n\nmatch result {\n    Ok(_) => println!(\"Timing update completed successfully.\"),\n    Err(e) => eprintln!(\"Error: {:?}\", e),\n}\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n- **MPI Support**: This crate leverages MPI for parallel computation. Ensure your environment is properly configured with an MPI implementation.\n\n## Installation\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-timing-update = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## License\nThis crate is distributed under the MIT License.\n\n*This README.md was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good.*",
