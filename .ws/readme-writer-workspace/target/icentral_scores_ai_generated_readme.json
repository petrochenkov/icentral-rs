  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Scores\n\n`icentral-scores` is a Rust crate designed for calculating and managing betweenness centrality scores within network graphs. Betweenness centrality is a measure of a node's importance based on the number of shortest paths that pass through it within a network. This crate provides mechanisms to efficiently compute, update, and manage these scores to facilitate high-performance graph analysis.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Flexible Score Calculation:** Supports generating betweenness scores from a graph reference or specific node identifiers.\n- **Dynamic Score Updates:** Offers methods to incrementally adjust scores for individual nodes, allowing for real-time graph analysis.\n- **Efficient Data Structures:** Utilizes `MaybeIndexedMap` to store and manage betweenness scores effectively with features like halving values or clearing all scores.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### Traits\n\n- **CreateScoresVector:** Implement this trait to generate a vector of betweenness scores.\n- **SpawnScores:** Use this for spawning or initializing scores in a custom manner.\n- **BrandesIterUpdatePairDependenciesAndFill:** Facilitates updating scores based on the Brandes iterative method, a well-known algorithm for computing betweenness centrality.\n\n### Structs\n\n- **BetweennessScores:** The central structure that holds, manages, and operates on node scores. It can be initialized from graphs or node ids and provides utilities for score manipulation.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-scores = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo start using `icentral-scores`, implement the provided traits in your application to handle betweenness score calculations and adjustments. Here is an example:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_scores::{BetweennessScores, CreateScoresVector};\n\nfn main() {\n    // Example initialization of scores\n    let scores = BetweennessScores::new_from_graph_ref(&graph, \"example_scores\");\n    // Manipulate and access scores as needed\n}\n```\n\n## Note\n\nThis README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, though it strives to be detailed and useful.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n",
