  "full_readme_markdown": "# Icentral-Mindexed-Map\n\n`icentral-mindexed-map` is a Rust crate providing a versatile data structure with dual functionalities: indexed and mapped collections. This crate offers the ability to seamlessly transition between vector-based indexed storage and hash map-based key-value storage. The primary goal of this crate is to offer flexibility and efficiency in handling collections, catering to varying needs of index-based and key-based data storage.\n\n## Features\n\n- **MaybeIndexedMap Enum**: A flexible data structure allowing the use of either vectors or hash maps.\n- **Efficient Iterators**: Built-in iterators for traversing indexed and mapped structures.\n- **Range and Node-Based Access**: Support for standard and custom indexing through `NodeId`.\n- **Utility Functions**: Includes methods for map creation, clearing, filling, reservation, and key extraction.\n\n## Data Structure Description\n\n- **MaybeIndexedMap<T>**: An enum implementing either an indexed representation using `Vec<T>` or a mapped representation using `HashMap<NodeId, T>`.\n  - `Indexed(Vec<T>)`: Utilizes a sequential vector for storage, suited for dense data.\n  - `Mapped(HashMap<NodeId, T>)`: Uses a hash map, ideal for sparse structures.\n- **MaybeIndexedMapIterator<T>**: An iterator over `MaybeIndexedMap`, providing efficient traversal of both representations.\n- **NodeIdEnumerate**: Facilitates enumeration with a node identifier.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- When you need both dense and sparse data storage in a single application.\n- Scenarios requiring switching between fast index access and flexible associative mapping.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_mindexed_map::{MaybeIndexedMap, NodeId};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut indexed_map = MaybeIndexedMap::new(5, 10);\n    indexed_map.set(NodeId::new(3), 20);\n\n    println!(\"Indexed Map: {:?}\", indexed_map);\n\n    let mut mapped = MaybeIndexedMap::<i32>::default();\n    mapped.set(NodeId::new(1), 42);\n    mapped.set(NodeId::new(2), 99);\n\n    println!(\"Mapped: {:?}\", mapped);\n}\n```\n\n## Note\n\nThis README is generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate.
