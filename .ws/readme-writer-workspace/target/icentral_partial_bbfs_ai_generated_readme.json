  "full_readme_markdown": "# ICentral Partial BBFS\n\n## Overview\n\n`icentral-partial-bbfs` is a Rust crate designed to manage dynamic changes in graphs by leveraging a variant of the Betweenness Centrality computations through Partial Brandes' Breadth-First Searching (BBFS). The primary functionality of this crate lies in allowing efficient updates to the workspace representation of a graph upon addition or deletion of edges, ensuring that alterations in betweenness centrality are accurately captured and efficiently recalculated.\n\n## Functionality\n\n- **`update_workspace_for_partial_bbfs_addition`**: This function updates the graph's workspace upon an edge addition. It iteratively calculates new path counts and modifies the workspace's internal data structures to reflect the change.\n\n- **`partial_bbfs_addition`**: Handles the introduction of a new edge into the graph. The function determines the optimal direction for computing paths and subsequently manages workspace updates to encapsulate this structural addition.\n\n- **`partial_bbfs_deletion`**: This function is designed to manage the removal of an edge. Utilizing a full reconstruction strategy temporarily, it re-initializes pertinent data structures, acknowledges the edge removal, and recalculates relevant betweenness centrality scores.\n\n## Technical Insights\n\nThe crate employs nuanced techniques like reversing edges for optimal distance calculations and utilizing an internal queue to manage graph traversal states efficiently.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis crate uses Rust edition 2021. Note: current edge deletion does full re-computation, highlighting pending optimizations.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_partial_bbfs::{ICentralWorkspace, Component, NodeIdQueue, Edge, NodeId, BetweennessCentralityError};\n\nlet mut workspace = ICentralWorkspace::new(...);\nlet mut component = Component::new(...);\nlet source: NodeId = ...;\nlet inserted_edge: Edge = ...;\nlet deleted_edge: Edge = ...;\n\npartial_bbfs_addition(&mut workspace, &mut component, source, inserted_edge).unwrap();\n\npartial_bbfs_deletion(&mut workspace, &component, source, &deleted_edge).unwrap();\n```\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis README.md was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, however, it should be pretty good.",
