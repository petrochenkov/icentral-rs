  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Workspace\n\n## Overview\n\niCentral Workspace is a Rust crate designed to facilitate intricate data manipulation and storage for calculations involving centrality in large graph structures. It helps manage dynamic graph updates by efficiently tracking and updating required metrics during graph modifications.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThe `ICentralWorkspace` struct serves as a container for managing graph-related data during iterative processes of the iCentral algorithm. The workspace captures key metrics like path counts, node distances, and intermediary computation results before and after graph edge insertions.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Initialization\n\nCreate a new instance of the `ICentralWorkspace` with the desired size and name:\n\n```rust\nlet workspace = ICentralWorkspace::new_init_all(nodes_count, \"workspace_name\");\n```\n\n### Public Interface\n\n- **Sigma Management**: Retrieve or set new sigma values using `new_sigmas()` and associated methods to keep track of path counts.\n- **Delta Management**: Calculate and update delta values during path recalculations for centrality measures.\n- **Distance and Parent Handling**: Efficiently manage vertex distances and parent references to construct and update shortest paths.\n\n### Efficiency Enhancements\n\nThe crate includes advanced methods such as `fix_order_of_workspace_stack`, utilizing optimized sorting techniques for performance improvement, presenting opportunities for further optimization in bottleneck areas.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Updating Sigma Values\n\n```rust\nworkspace.set_new_sigmas_from(&other_sigmas);\n```\n\n### Path and Delta Management\n\n```rust\nworkspace.compute_new_path_counts_and_paths(src_node, dst_node);\nworkspace.update_new_deltas_with_new_sigma_ratio(v_p, v_n);\n```\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n- The library is architectured for flexibility, allowing adjustments in data handling and internal computations.\n- Designed with future scalability in mind, the crate anticipates potential improvements, optimizing storage and retrieval operations as graph complexity evolves.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, though it strives for precise and useful information.\n",
