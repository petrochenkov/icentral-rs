It provides a sophisticated framework for graph algorithms with a focus on minimum union cycles (MUCs), betweenness centrality, and biconnected components.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n- **Minimum Union Cycle (MUC):** At the heart of the library is the MUC, an intricate data structure to represent cycles within a graph. The library facilitates operations such as constructing, finding, and updating minimum union cycles.\n- **Betweenness Centrality:** Utilize algorithms to compute the betweenness centrality, which is crucial for identifying the most pivotal vertices in respect to information flow within the graph.\n- **Graph Debugging:** Comprehensive debug utilities to assist in visualizing and diagnosing the state of graph edges and cycles in various forms.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Graph Initialization:** Start with `Graph::empty()` to initialize a new graph instance, then populate it via `insert_edge()`.\n- **Advanced Debugging Traits:** Leverage traits such as `SetMucDebug` and `GetEdgeListDebugger` for in-depth visualization of graph elements.\n- **Efficiency in Graph Operations:** Exploit methods like `find_edge_bcc_with_delta` for efficient exploration and manipulation of graph structures.\n- **Connected Components:** Use `find_edge_bcc_with_component` to retrieve articulation points and subgraph sizes linked to these points.\n- **MUC-Based Operations:** Seamlessly execute MUC-based algorithms, including construction and exploration of subgraphs derived from MUCs.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_graph::Graph;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut graph = Graph::empty(\"example_graph\");\n    graph.init_size(5);\n    graph.insert_edge(&Edge::new(0, 1));\n    graph.insert_edge(&Edge::new(1, 2));\n    println!(\"Graph with {} edges: {:?}\", graph.num_edges(), graph);\n}\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis crate builds on Rust's 2021 edition, ensuring maximum compatibility with modern Rust practices.\n\n## Contribution\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community. Please adhere to the coding standards outlined and make use of the issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, however, it should be quite useful.\n",
