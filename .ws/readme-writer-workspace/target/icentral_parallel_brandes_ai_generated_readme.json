  "full_readme_markdown": "# Icentral Parallel Brandes\n\nThe `icentral-parallel-brandes` crate implements an optimized parallel version of Brandes' algorithm to compute betweenness centrality in large-scale graphs. This algorithm distributes computation across multiple threads, thereby achieving enhanced efficiency and performance compared to its sequential counterpart.\n\n## Overview\nBrandes' algorithm is a fundamental technique in network analysis for quantifying the importance of nodes within a graph based on shortest paths. This crate leverages Rust's concurrency capabilities to improve the execution time with parallel computation, enabling rapid analysis of substantial graphs.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Parallel Execution**: Utilizes multiple threads to process subgraphs concurrently, which reduces computation time significantly.\n- **Generic Graph Interface**: Works with any graph structure implementing the `NumNodes`, `MappedNodes`, `GetNodeIdRange`, `GetNeighborsForNode`, and `GetEdges` traits.\n- **Efficient Memory Management**: The design ensures minimal overhead and optimal performance through careful allocation and deallocation.\n\n## Usage\nTo use this crate, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-parallel-brandes = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\nThen, import and use the `parallel_brandes` function in your Rust code:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_parallel_brandes::parallel_brandes;\n\n// Assume `MyGraph` implements necessary traits\nlet my_graph = MyGraph::new();\nlet mut scores = BetweennessScores::new();\n\nparallel_brandes(&my_graph, &mut scores).expect(\"Algorithm execution failed\");\n```\n\n## About\nThis crate is suited for applications in network analysis, where analyzing the betweenness centrality of nodes in massive graphs is crucial such as social network analysis, infrastructure planning, and more.\n\n**Note**: This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should provide significant guidance.\n\n## Further Reading\nFurther understanding of the algorithm's theoretical background can be found in U.
