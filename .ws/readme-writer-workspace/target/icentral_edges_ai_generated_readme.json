  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral-Edges\n\n`icentral-edges` is a Rust crate designed for advanced manipulation and analysis of graph edges, providing extensible trait-based interfaces for edge-centric operations. This library caters to developers working with complex graph data structures, offering elegant solutions for edge management and traversal.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Edge Management**: Easily track, add, and remove edges in your graph with traits like `InsertEdge`, `RemoveEdge`, and more.\n- **Graph Traversability**: Efficiently query edge connections with `connects`, `edges_to_node`, and `edges_from_node` methods.\n- **Data Structure Implementation**: Employs `HashSet` for optimal edge storage and retrieval.\n- **Custom Naming**: Support for naming edge collections with `SetName` and related methods.\n- **Batch Operations**: Create edge collections from vectors or sets and extend existing collections.\n\n## Getting Started\nTo utilize `icentral-edges`, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-edges = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\nImplement the provided traits on your graph structures to seamlessly integrate edge functionalities.\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_edges::{Edges, InsertEdge, RemoveEdge};\n\nlet mut edges = Edges::empty(\"my_graph_edges\");\n\n// Insert an edge\nlet result = edges.insert_edge(&Edge::new(1, 2));\nassert!(result.is_ok());\n\n// Check for connections\nassert!(edges.connects(1, 2));\n\n// Remove an edge\nlet result = edges.remove_edge(&Edge::new(1, 2));\nassert!(result.is_ok());\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nThis README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be highly reliable.\n\n---\n\nFor more comprehensive documentation, please refer to the source code and inline comments.
