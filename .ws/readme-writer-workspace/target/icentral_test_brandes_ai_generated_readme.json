  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-test-brandes\n\n`icentral-test-brandes` is a Rust crate designed for efficiently calculating betweenness centrality using Brandes' algorithm. This crate provides high-performance methods for processing graph structures, allowing users to compute centrality metrics which are imperative for understanding the influence of each node within a network.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Iterative Betweenness Calculation**: Supports both bounded and all iterations for flexibility in performance tuning.\n- **Comprehensive Timing**: Precisely measures computation duration, making it valuable for benchmarking and performance analysis.\n\n## Functionality\n\n### `exp_brandes_p`\nExecutes the Brandes centrality algorithm on a given graph, with support for either a defined number of iterations or all possible iterations. Current implementation notes on `max_time` parameter demonstrate ongoing enhancements.\n\n### `exp_brandes_p_all_iterations`\nPerforms the centrality calculations across all possible iterations, leveraging the complete node set within the graph.\n\n### `exp_brandes_p_bounded_iterations`\nOptimizes the calculation process by restricting the number of iterations, beneficial for larger graphs with performance constraints.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:\n    ```toml\n    [dependencies]\n    icentral-test-brandes = \"0.1.0\"\n    ```\n\n2. Use the functions in your Rust code, analyzing graph structures to determine the influence of nodes.\n\nThis README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good for understanding the crate's functionality.",
