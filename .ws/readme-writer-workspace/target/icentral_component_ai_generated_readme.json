  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-component\n\n`icentral-component` is a Rust crate providing powerful tools for manipulating and analyzing graph components with a focus on computing graph betweenness centrality. The crate allows the user to efficiently manage and operate on diverse types of components such as biconnected components, minimum union cycles, and general graphs.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Component Types**: Represent and transition between different graph component types.\n- **Edge-Based Betweenness Centrality**: Implementations for finding and utilizing edge-based biconnected components to perform complex computations.\n- **Subgraph Manipulation**: Build, manipulate, and debug subgraphs with articulation points.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- **Biconnected Components**: These are maximal subgraphs with no node whose removal disconnects them. \n- **Minimum Union Cycles**: These are the simplest cycles enclosing a set of edges.\n- **Articulation Points**: Nodes whose removal increases the graph's number of connected components.\n\n## Usage\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_component::{Component, CompType};\n\nlet my_graph = ... // Assume a graph object implementing required traits\nlet component = Component::new_from_graph_ref(&my_graph, \"example\");\n\nmatch component.ty() {\n    CompType::Graph => println!(\"This is a basic graph.\"),\n    CompType::BiconnectedComponent => println!(\"This is a biconnected component.\"),\n    CompType::MinimumUnionCycle => println!(\"This is a minimum union cycle.\"),\n}\n\n// Further operations\n```\n\n## Installation\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\ndependencies = {\n    icentral-component = \"0.1.0\"\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome!
