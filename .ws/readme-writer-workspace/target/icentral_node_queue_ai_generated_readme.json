  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-node-queue\n\n`icentral-node-queue` is a Rust crate designed to manage a queue of node identifiers (NodeId) efficiently and reliably. This crate offers a robust `NodeIdQueue` struct along with a macro `delegate_to_bfs_queue` to facilitate the implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. \n\n`NodeIdQueue` acts as a named queue, allowing you to store and manage node identifiers, imperative for graph traversal and related operations.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Queue Operations**: Supports common queue operations such as `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `peek`.\n- **Named Queues**: Each queue is identifiable by a unique string name, making management of multiple queues straightforward.\n- **Creation Methods**: Easily instantiate named empty queues or start a new queue with an initial node.\n- **Debugging**: Built-in debug logs give detailed insights into queue operations, fostering efficient error tracking and debugging.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo utilize the `icentral-node-queue`, you must include it in your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-node-queue = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_node_queue::{NodeIdQueue, delegate_to_bfs_queue};\n\nfn main() {\n    let first_node = NodeId::new(1);\n    let mut queue = NodeIdQueue::new(first_node, \"example_queue\");\n\n    // Enqueue a node\n    queue.enqueue(NodeId::new(2));\n\n    // Peek at the first node in the queue\n    if let Some(node) = queue.peek() {\n        println!(\"Next node in queue: {:?}\", node);\n    }\n\n    // Dequeue a node\n    if let Some(dequeued_node) = queue.dequeue() {\n        println!(\"Dequeued node: {:?}\", dequeued_node);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
