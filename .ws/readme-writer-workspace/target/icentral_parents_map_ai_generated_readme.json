  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-parents-map\n\n`icentral-parents-map` provides a robust data structure for managing parent-child relationships between nodes, widely applicable in domains such as graph theory, dependency tracking, and hierarchical systems.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Node Parent Management**: Add, set, and retrieve parents for nodes.\n- **Clearance Functions**: Remove all or specific node's parents.\n- **Dynamic Structure Initialization**: Flexible methods for initializing and reinitializing structures with different sizes.\n\n## Usage\n\nIntegrate this crate to efficiently manage node relationships through a rich API surface encapsulated in Rust traits.\n\n### Public Traits\n\n- `NumParentsForNode`: Retrieve the number of parents for a given node.\n- `ParentsForNode`: Obtain the list of parents for a node.\n- `ClearParents`, `ClearNodeParents`: Functions to clear parent linkage.\n- `SetParentsForNode`, `SetSingleParent`: Set multiple or single parents for nodes.\n- `HasParent`: Check if a node has a specified parent.\n- `AddParent`: Add a parent to a specific node.\n\n### Example\n\n```rust\nuse crate::{ParentsMap, NodeId};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut pm = ParentsMap::new(5, \"example\");\n    let node = NodeId(1);\n    let parent = NodeId(2);\n    pm.set_single_parent(node, parent);\n    assert!(pm.has_parent(node, parent));\n}\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n- Utilize `delegate_to_parents` macro for efficient trait delegation.\n- Suitable for graph-based implementations with nodes indexed using `NodeId`.\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the provisions of both MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses.\n\n--- \n\n*This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, though it aims to provide high utility and comprehensible content.*",
