  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Errors Crate\n\nThe `icentral-errors` crate provides robust error handling utilities specifically tailored for applications dealing with betweenness centrality computations. This crate simplifies error management and offers clear semantics when handling edge cases that arise in complex graph-algorithm operations.\n\n### Features\n\n- **Poison Message Trait**: An abstraction over error objects to facilitate the creation of descriptive error messages through the `PoisonMessage` trait.\n- **BetweennessCentralityError Enum**: A comprehensive error enumeration specifically designed to cover typical anomalies encountered in centrality calculations.\n- **Conversions and Implementations**:\n  - Easily convert synchronization-related errors, specifically `PoisonError`, into betweenness centrality specific errors using custom `From` implementations.\n  - Error constructors for common scenarios like no key presence and data mismatches with detailed diff reporting.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_errors::BCError;\n\nfn process_centrality() -> Result<(), BCError> {\n    // ... your algorithm\n    Err(BCError::no_key(42))\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Getting Started\n\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-errors = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n### About\n\nThis crate was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate. However, it is designed to offer substantial utility and a pattern-rich foundation for error management in graph-related computation scenarios.\n",
