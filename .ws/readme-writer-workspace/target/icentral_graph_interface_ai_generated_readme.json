  "full_readme_markdown": "# iCentral Graph Interface\n\n`icentral-graph-interface` is a robust Rust crate structured to empower developers working with graph structures and implementing graph-theoretic algorithms. This crate provides traits that abstract functionalities related to graph traversal, pathfinding, and the management of complex graph-based data structures, and is specifically oriented towards tasks involving Minimum Union Cycles and Betweenness Centrality, among other complex computations.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Graph Validation**: Utilize `IsValid` to ascertain graph correctness.\n- **Minimum Cycle Basis Identification**: Employ `McbFind` to find algorithmically relevant cycles.\n- **Iterative Debugger**: Use `InitDebugIteration` and `DebugIterationStep` for detailed iteration debugging.\n- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Apply `FindSingleSourceShortestPaths` for efficient shortest path calculations.\n- **Distance Mapping**: Leverage `CreateDistanceMaps` to generate comprehensive distance maps.\n- **Betweenness Centrality**: Initialize with `InitBetweennessCentrality` for advanced centrality analysis.\n- **Graph Connectivity**: Analyze connected components and pruning with `GetConnectedComponentSizes` and `FindPruningCounts`.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the following line to your `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:\n\n```toml\nicentral-graph-interface = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nImplement the desired traits in a struct managing your graph data:\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_graph_interface::{IsValid, McbFind, PrintHeader};\n\nstruct MyGraph;\n\nimpl IsValid for MyGraph {\n    fn is_valid(&self) -> bool {\n        // Implement logic to validate graph\n        true\n    }\n}\n\nimpl McbFind for MyGraph {\n    fn mcb_find(&self) {\n        // Implement logic to find minimum cycle basis\n    }\n}\n\nimpl PrintHeader for MyGraph {\n    fn print_header(&self) {\n        // Logic to print graph header\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome and appreciate contributions.
