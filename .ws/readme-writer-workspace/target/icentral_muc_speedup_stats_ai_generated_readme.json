It efficiently summarizes graph parameters and their relation to ideal computational speedup outcomes.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe core structure, `MucSpeedupStats`, encapsulates a rich set of metrics:\n- **`muc_num_nodes`**: Number of nodes in the MUC.\n- **`muc_num_edges`**: Number of edges in the MUC.\n- **`graph_len`**: Total number of nodes in the graph.\n- **`graph_num_edges`**: Total number of edges in the graph.\n- **`ideal_speedup`**: A measure of the potential maximum speedup achievable.\n- **`edge_ins_time`**: Duration of edge insertions, in terms of computational time taken.\n\nThis crate allows for debugging with a formatted output illustrating crucial ratios, such as node and edge density within the MUC compared to the full graph utilizing Rust's `fmt::Debug` implementation.\n\n## Installation\nAdd this crate to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-muc-speedup-stats = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Usage\nBelow is an example of how to use `MucSpeedupStats`:\n```rust\nuse icentral-muc-speedup-stats::MucSpeedupStats;\nuse std::time::Duration;\n\nlet stats = MucSpeedupStats {\n    muc_num_nodes: 50,\n    muc_num_edges: 100,\n    graph_len: 200,\n    graph_num_edges: 400,\n    ideal_speedup: 1.5,\n    edge_ins_time: Duration::new(2, 0),\n};\n\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", stats);\n```\n\n## Technical Background\nThe `MucSpeedupStats` struct serves to quantify the relationship between a subgraph (MUC) and its corresponding whole graph, facilitating computational analyses based on node and edge densities. It provides a comprehensive snapshot of how a MUC diverges or aligns in terms of size and efficiency potential compared to the broader graph.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n*This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be quite informative.*",
