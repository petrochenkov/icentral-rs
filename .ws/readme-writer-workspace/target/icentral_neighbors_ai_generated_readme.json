  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-neighbors\n\n`icentral-neighbors` offers a sophisticated framework for graph manipulation operations, including edge handling and node management within neighbor maps, geared towards advanced users building complex graph-based applications.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis crate furnishes a robust set of traits and implementations for handling node and edge operations efficiently in graph data structures. Designed specifically for high-performance graph parsing and manipulation, it integrates seamlessly with existing graph representations and offers extensive capability in node and edge manipulation, as well as dynamic graph alterations.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Graph Node and Edge Manipulation**: Provides utilities for adding, removing, and unlinking nodes and edges.\n- **Customizable Neighbor Structures**: Allows customization of neighbor sets for specific graph nodes.\n- **Efficient Graph Initialization and Reinitialization**: Facilitates efficient setup and teardown of graph structures with minimal overhead.\n- **Compatibility with Indexed Maps**: Utilizes `MaybeIndexedMap` for enhanced compatibility and performance optimization in managing graph mappings.\n\n## Usage\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_neighbors::{GetNodes, AddEdge, NeighborsMap};\n\n// Initialize a NeighborsMap\nlet mut neighbors_map = NeighborsMap::new(6, \"MyGraph\");\n\n// Add an edge\nneighbors_map.add_edge(&Edge { src: 1, dst: 2 });\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-neighbors = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\nContributions to further enhance the capabilities of `icentral-neighbors` are welcome. Please follow established guidelines for code contributions.\n\n## License\n\n`icentral-neighbors` is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n---\n\n*This README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate, although it should be quite reliable.*",
