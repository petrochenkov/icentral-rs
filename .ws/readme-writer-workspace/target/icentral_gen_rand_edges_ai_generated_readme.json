  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-gen-rand-edges\n\nThe `icentral-gen-rand-edges` crate offers robust functionality for generating random edges within graph structures. Designed to operate efficiently within the Rust ecosystem, this crate is particularly useful for simulations and randomized algorithms in graph and network theory.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Random Edge Generation**: Create edges not currently present in a given graph, ensuring no duplicates or self-loops. This is particularly advantageous for testing algorithms that require randomized inputs.\n- **Non-Bridge Edge Selection**: Efficiently generate deletions by selecting random edges that are part of the graph yet not bridges. This functionality respects the integrity of the connected components in network analysis.\n\n## Technical Overview\n\nThe primary functions of this crate rely on type constraints and traits:\n- `gen_rand_edges` uses `NumNodes` and `HasEdge` traits to generate unique edges.\n- `gen_rand_edges_deletions` employs `FindBridgeEdges`, `NumEdges`, and `GetEdges` to ensure edges selected are not bridges.\n\n### Example Code\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_gen_rand_edges::{gen_rand_edges, gen_rand_edges_deletions};\nuse some_graph_library::{Graph, WyRand};\n\nlet mut rng = WyRand::default();\nlet mut my_graph = Graph::new();\nlet random_edges = gen_rand_edges(&mut rng, 10, &my_graph).unwrap();\nlet deletions = gen_rand_edges_deletions(5, &mut my_graph);\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIntegrate `icentral-gen-rand-edges` in your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-gen-rand-edges = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\nThis crate is designed for those advancing in graph theory, algorithmic design, or network simulations. The functional paradigm, aligned with the 2021 edition of Rust, ensures modern syntax and performance optimizations.\n\n---\n\n*This README.md was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate but should be pretty good.*\n",
