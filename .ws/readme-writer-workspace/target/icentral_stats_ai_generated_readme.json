  "full_readme_markdown": "# icentral-stats\n\n`icentral-stats` is a Rust crate providing statistical analysis utilities tailored for performance measurements. It facilitates the extraction of central tendency and variability metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation. This crate is especially useful when handling timing data in durations or floating-point formats.\n\n## Features\n\n- **SpeedupStats**: Analyses a mutable vector of `f64` values, providing quick insights into dataset characteristics including mean, standard deviation, and median.\n- **EdgeStat**: Captures performance-related statistics associated with edge processing within graphs, encapsulating insertion time and update times.\n- **SimpleStats**: Computes essential statistics on durations, thereby assisting in performance profiling.\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_stats::{SpeedupStats, SimpleStats};\nuse std::time::Duration;\n\nlet mut float_data: Vec<f64> = vec![2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0];\nlet speedup_stats = SpeedupStats::from(&mut float_data);\nprintln!(\"SpeedupStats: {:?}\", speedup_stats);\n\nlet mut duration_data: Vec<Duration> = vec![Duration::new(5, 0), Duration::new(10, 0)];\nlet simple_stats = SimpleStats::from(&mut duration_data);\nprintln!(\"SimpleStats: {:?}\", simple_stats);\n```\n\nThe `icentral-stats` library is designed to address the core needs of performance analysis, where both floating-point and duration data types are involved.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nicentral-stats = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n## Note\nThis README.md file was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be pretty good.\n",
