The crate implements a `DistanceMap` structure to efficiently store and update node distances, providing utilities for various distance comparisons and manipulations. This is particularly useful for algorithms dealing with pathfinding, graph traversal, or network analysis.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Macro**: `delegate_to_distances!` facilitates ease of use and abstraction in repetitive distance operations.\n- **Data Structure**: The `DistanceMap` utilizes an `MaybeIndexedMap<f64>` to store distances associated with nodes in a graph.\n- **Convenient Methods**: Includes methods to create, reinitialize and manipulate distance maps, as well as operations for comparing distances between nodes.\n\n## Core Methods\n\n- **Initialization**: `new_from_nodes`, `empty_indexed`, `empty_mapped`, `new` for creating and initializing instances of `DistanceMap`.\n- **Comparison**: `v_closer_than_u`, `is_farther_away`, `is_farther_than_one_away`, `is_one_step_away`, functions for comparing node distances.\n- **Distance Manipulation**: `set_distance_for_node`, `insert_node_at_infinite_distance`, `set_one_step_away`, `set_zero_distance`, methods for setting or modifying distances.\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```rust\nuse icentral_distances::DistanceMap;\n\nfn main() {\n    let nodes = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n    let mut distance_map = DistanceMap::new_from_nodes(nodes, \"example_map\");\n    // Set the distance for a node\n    distance_map.set_distance_for_node(1, 5.0);\n    // Check if one node is closer than another\n    let is_closer = distance_map.v_closer_than_u(2, 3);\n    println!(\"Node 2 is closer to the source than Node 3: {}\", is_closer);\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Concepts\n\nThe `DistanceMap` leverages a flexible distance model which is compatible with both indexed and mapped representations. This adaptability makes it a suitable choice for diverse applications ranging from simple graphs to complex network simulations.\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions and feedback are welcome. Please open issues on the GitHub repository for bug reports or feature requests.\n\n---\n\n*This README was generated by an AI model and may not be 100% accurate; however, it should be quite informative.*",
