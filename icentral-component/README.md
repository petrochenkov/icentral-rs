# icentral-component

`icentral-component` is a Rust crate providing powerful tools for manipulating and analyzing graph components with a focus on computing graph betweenness centrality. The crate allows the user to efficiently manage and operate on diverse types of components such as biconnected components, minimum union cycles, and general graphs.

## Features

- **Component Types**: Represent and transition between different graph component types.
- **Edge-Based Betweenness Centrality**: Implementations for finding and utilizing edge-based biconnected components to perform complex computations.
- **Subgraph Manipulation**: Build, manipulate, and debug subgraphs with articulation points.

## Key Concepts

- **Biconnected Components**: These are maximal subgraphs with no node whose removal disconnects them. 
- **Minimum Union Cycles**: These are the simplest cycles enclosing a set of edges.
- **Articulation Points**: Nodes whose removal increases the graph's number of connected components.

## Usage

```rust
use icentral_component::{Component, CompType};

let my_graph = ... // Assume a graph object implementing required traits
let component = Component::new_from_graph_ref(&my_graph, "example");

match component.ty() {
    CompType::Graph => println!("This is a basic graph."),
    CompType::BiconnectedComponent => println!("This is a biconnected component."),
    CompType::MinimumUnionCycle => println!("This is a minimum union cycle."),
}

// Further operations
```

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
dependencies = {
    icentral-component = "0.1.0"
}
```

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. Currently, it still needs exhaustive testing.  It is likely there currently exist many glitches which need to be fixed before proper usage. This crate is based on the original icentral program developed by Fuad Jamor. Please see the following repository for details: https://github.com/fjamour/icentral.

For progress updates, see the workspacer rust project.
