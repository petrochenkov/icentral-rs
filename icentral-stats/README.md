# icentral-stats

`icentral-stats` is a Rust crate providing statistical analysis utilities tailored for performance measurements. It facilitates the extraction of central tendency and variability metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation. This crate is especially useful when handling timing data in durations or floating-point formats.

## Features

- **SpeedupStats**: Analyses a mutable vector of `f64` values, providing quick insights into dataset characteristics including mean, standard deviation, and median.
- **EdgeStat**: Captures performance-related statistics associated with edge processing within graphs, encapsulating insertion time and update times.
- **SimpleStats**: Computes essential statistics on durations, thereby assisting in performance profiling.

## Usage Example

```rust
use icentral_stats::{SpeedupStats, SimpleStats};
use std::time::Duration;

let mut float_data: Vec<f64> = vec![2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0];
let speedup_stats = SpeedupStats::from(&mut float_data);
println!("SpeedupStats: {:?}", speedup_stats);

let mut duration_data: Vec<Duration> = vec![Duration::new(5, 0), Duration::new(10, 0)];
let simple_stats = SimpleStats::from(&mut duration_data);
println!("SimpleStats: {:?}", simple_stats);
```

The `icentral-stats` library is designed to address the core needs of performance analysis, where both floating-point and duration data types are involved.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icentral-stats = "0.1.0"
```
